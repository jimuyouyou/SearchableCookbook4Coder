	<b>
		1. When a property reference to an object is made, first the object itself is checked to
		see if the property exists. If it does, the value is taken. If not...
	</b>
	<b>
		2. The prototype associated with the object is located and it is checked for the property.
		If it exists, the value is take. If not...
	</b>
	<b>
		3. The value is undefined

		Each object in JavaScript has an implicit property named constructor that references the
		constructor that was used to create the object. And because the prototype is a property of
		the constructor, each object has a way to find its prototype.

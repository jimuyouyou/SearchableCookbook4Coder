	<h1>General solution for avoiding Javascript memory leak</h1>
	<div>
		For some devices, like mobile phone, pad and TV, there are many reasons that can crash your web pages:
		<ul>
			<li>Multile loading of static files
<pre>
	common static files includes: javascript, css and pictures
	Almost all browsers will automatically cache these files and they will not download static files for the second time. However, some apps would like to add a mark to url link for forcing the browser to load the latest static files. This is not necessary. 

	examples: good.jpg?v=34, main.css?date=04, dashboard.js?20150506
	Solution: remove all the characters after '?'
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>javascript memory leak</li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	cirular reference > set obj = null to break the reference
	ajax > set obj = null to break the global reference 
	setInterval then clearInterval
	outer calls inner function set outer = null as early as possible
	jQuery.cache data persists removeData() detach() 
	event handling with colure causes obj and dom circular reference
	jQuery Check the size of $.cache
	remove an object before reusing it; obj = null; obj = new Obj;

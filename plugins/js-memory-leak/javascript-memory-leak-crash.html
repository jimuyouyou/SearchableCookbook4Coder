Solutions for the dashboard crash issue:
Generally speaking, I would prefer to use ajax call instead of page refreshing. 
Although, you can try to implement #1 step first to view whether it works. 
If #1 doesn't work, then implement #2. If both don't work, implement all steps listed below.

1. Remove all marks after static files
examples: good.jpg?v=34, main.css?date=04, dashboard.js?20150506
Solution: remove all the character after '?'

2. Avoid using iframe
Many person complains that iframe can cause circular reference, so avoid using it

3. make ajax call and page refresh work together
ajax calls can avoid unnecessary loading of both static resources and data,
while page refresh will enable the browser to release memory current page owns.
But both of these two mechnism don't work well on all browsers. 
So ideal solution is: 
a. use ajax call as the main method, say 30 seconds per call, 
b. and then after 10 minutes, make a completely refresh of the page, say refresh to dashboard.action
Note: make sure to avoid using iframe, as it may not be released by some portable device browsers

4. javascript leak
a. avoid event handler caused object circular reference
Example:
var obj = $('#id');
$(obj).onclick(function(){}) // event handler onclick is dom Object, circular reference with javascript object obj
obj = null; // this is very important for breaking the cicular reference

b. release ajax object itself
$.ajax({ 
url: "http://www.jb51.net", 
data: { name: "xxxx" }, 
dataType: "xml", 
success: function (data, textStatus) { 
//do something... 
}, 
complete: function (XHR, TS) { XHR = null }  //  this is very important for breaking the cicular reference

});

c. use setInterval instead of setTimeout
Do remember to clearInterval first, example good code:
clearInterval(obj); //  this is very important
ar obj =self.setInterval("clock()",50)

d. drop jquery element and cache
$.removeData('div', 'hello');
$( "div" ).remove( ".hello" );

		There are also some indirect ways to set up the model from the template itself. You can
		do so in the following ways:
		1. Through an expression. Since expressions execute in the context of the controller’s
		scope associated with their element, setting properties in expressions is the same
		as setting a property of the controller’s scope. That is, doing this:
		
		2. Using ng-model on a form input. As with expressions, the model specified as the
		argument for ng-model also works within the scope of the enclosing controller. The
		one addition is that this creates a bi-directional data binding between the form field
		state and your specified model.

	<textarea name="" id="" cols="100" rows="10">
		<button ng-click='count=3'>Set count to three</button>
		has the same effect as doing this:
		<div ng-controller='CountController'>
			<button ng-click='setCount()'>Set count to three</button>
		</div>
		with your CountController defined as:
		function CountController($scope) {
				$scope.setCount = function() {
				$scope.count=3;
			}
		}
</textarea>

		Though we express this as nested controllers, the actual nesting happens in scopes. The
		$scope passed to a nested controller prototypically inherits from its parent controllerâ€™s
		$scope . In this case, this means that the $scope passed to ChildController will have
		access to all the properties of the $scope passed to ParentController .

		#1 Declares named inline function and assigns it to a variable.
		#2 Tests that the tow names are equivalent inside the inline function.
		#3 Invokes function to perform the internal test.
		#4 Tests that the inline function’s name isn’t available outside the inline function.
		This listing brings up the most important point regarding inline function

		So while giving inline functions a name may provide a means to clearly allow recursive
		references within those function – arguably, this approach provides more clarity than using
		this – it has limited utility elsewhere.

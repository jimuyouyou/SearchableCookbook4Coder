		There are actually four different ways to invoke a function, each with their own nuances. They are:
		<ul>
			<li>1. As a function, in which the function is invoked in a straightforward manner.
				function ninja(){};
				ninja();
			</li>
			<li>2. As a method, which ties the invocation to an object, enabling object-oriented programming.
				var o = {};
				o.whatever = function(){};
				o.whatever();
			</li>
			<li>3. As a constructor, in which a new object is brought into being.
				function do(){}
				var d = new do();
			</li>
			<li>4. Via their apply() or call() methods</li>
		</ul>

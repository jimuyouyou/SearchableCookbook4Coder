<p><strong><em>Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites. What once took weeks, even with the best tools, now takes hours with Meteor.</em></strong></p>
<p>The web was originally designed to work in the same way that mainframes worked in the 70s. The application server rendered a screen and sent it over the network to a dumb terminal. Whenever the user did anything, that server rerendered a whole new screen. This model served the Web well for over a decade. It gave rise to LAMP, Rails, Django, PHP.</p>
<p>But the best teams, with the biggest budgets and the longest schedules, now build applications in JavaScript that run on the client. These apps have stellar interfaces. They don't reload pages. They are reactive: changes from any client immediately appear on everyone's screen.</p>
<p>They've built them the hard way. Meteor makes it an order of magnitude simpler, and a lot more fun. You can build a complete application in a weekend, or a sufficiently caffeinated hackathon. No longer do you need to provision server resources, or deploy API endpoints in the cloud, or manage a database, or wrangle an ORM layer, or swap back and forth between JavaScript and Ruby, or broadcast data invalidations to clients.</p>
<h2 id="quickstart">Quick start!</h2>

<h2 id="sevenprinciples">Principles of Meteor</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Data on the Wire</em>. Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>One Language.</em> Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your application in JavaScript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Database Everywhere</em>. You can use the same methods to access your database from the client or the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Latency Compensation</em>. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Full Stack Reactivity</em>. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Embrace the Ecosystem</em>. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Simplicity Equals Productivity</em>. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually <em>be</em> simple. Meteor's main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
We've written our fair share of single-page JavaScript applications by hand. Writing an entire application in one language (JavaScript) with one data format (JSON) is a real joy. Meteor is everything we wanted when writing those apps.
<h2 id="whatismeteor">What is Meteor?</h2>
<p>Meteor is two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>library of packages</em>: pre-written, self-contained modules that you might need in your app.</p>
<p>There are about a dozen core Meteor packages that most any app will use. Two examples: <a href="http://localhost:3000/#webapp"><code>webapp</code></a>, which handles incoming HTTP connections, and <code>templating</code>, which lets you make HTML templates that automatically update live as data changes. Then there are optional packages like <code>email</code>, which lets your app send emails, or the Meteor Accounts series (<code>accounts-password</code>, <code>accounts-facebook</code>, <code>accounts-ui</code>, and others) which provide a full-featured user account system that you can drop right into your app. In addition to these "core" packages, there are thousands of community-written packages in <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/">Atmosphere</a>, one of which might do just what you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>command-line tool</em> called <code>meteor</code>.</p>
<p><code>meteor</code> is a build tool analogous to <code>make</code>, <code>rake</code>, or the non-visual parts of Visual Studio. It gathers up all of the source files and assets in your application, carries out any necessary build steps (such as compiling <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, minifying CSS, building <a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a> modules, or generating source maps), fetches the packages used by your app, and outputs a standalone, ready-to-run application bundle. In development mode it can do all of this interactively, so that whenever you change a file you immediately see the changes in your browser. It's super easy to use out of the box, but it's also extensible: you can add support for new languages and compilers by adding build plugin packages to your app.</p>
<p>The key idea in the Meteor package system is that <em>everything should work identically in the browser and on the server</em> (wherever it makes sense, of course: browsers can't send email and servers can't capture mouse events). Our whole ecosystem has been built from the ground up to support this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structuringyourapp">Structuring your application</h2>
<p>A Meteor application is a mix of client-side JavaScript that runs inside a web browser or PhoneGap mobile app, server-side JavaScript that runs on the Meteor server inside a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> container, and all the supporting HTML templates, CSS rules, and static assets. Meteor automates the packaging and transmission of these different components, and it is quite flexible about how you choose to structure those components in your file tree.</p>
<h3 id="specialdirectories">Special Directories</h3>
<p>By default, any JavaScript files in your Meteor folder are bundled and sent to the client and the server. However, the names of the files and directories inside your project can affect their load order, where they are loaded, and some other characteristics. Here is a list of file and directory names that are treated specially by Meteor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>client</strong></p>
<p>Any directory named <code>client</code> is not loaded on the server. Similar to wrapping your code in <code>if (Meteor.isClient) { ... }</code>. All files loaded on the client are automatically concatenated and minified when in production mode. In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are not minified, to make debugging easier. (CSS files are still combined into a single file for consistency between production and development, because changing the CSS file's URL affects how URLs in it are processed.)</p>
<p>HTML files in a Meteor application are treated quite a bit differently from a server-side framework. Meteor scans all the HTML files in your directory for three top-level elements: <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>. The head and body sections are separately concatenated into a single head and body, which are transmitted to the client on initial page load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>server</strong></p>
<p>Any directory named <code>server</code> is not loaded on the client. Similar to wrapping your code in <code>if (Meteor.isServer) { ... }</code>, except the client never even receives the code. Any sensitive code that you don't want served to the client, such as code containing passwords or authentication mechanisms, should be kept in the <code>server</code> directory.</p>
<p>Meteor gathers all your JavaScript files, excluding anything under the <code>client</code>, <code>public</code>, and <code>private</code> subdirectories, and loads them into a Node.js server instance. In Meteor, your server code runs in a single thread per request, not in the asynchronous callback style typical of Node. We find the linear execution model a better fit for the typical server code in a Meteor application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>public</strong></p>
<p>All files inside a top-level directory called <code>public</code> are served as-is to the client. When referencing these assets, do not include <code>public/</code> in the URL, write the URL as if they were all in the top level. For example, reference <code>public/bg.png</code> as <code>&lt;img src='/bg.png' /&gt;</code>. This is the best place for <code>favicon.ico</code>, <code>robots.txt</code>, and similar files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>private</strong></p>
<p>All files inside a top-level directory called <code>private</code> are only accessible from server code and can be loaded via the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#assets"><code>Assets</code></a> API. This can be used for private data files and any files that are in your project directory that you don't want to be accessible from the outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>client/compatibility</strong></p>
<p>This folder is for compatibility JavaScript libraries that rely on variables declared with var at the top level being exported as globals. Files in this directory are executed without being wrapped in a new variable scope. These files are executed before other client-side JavaScript files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tests</strong></p>
<p>Any directory named <code>tests</code> is not loaded anywhere. Use this for any local test code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filesoutsidespecialdirectories">Files outside special directories</h3>
<p>All JavaScript files outside special directories are loaded on both the client and the server. That's the place for model definitions and other functions. Meteor provides the variables <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_isclient"><code>Meteor.isClient</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_isserver"><code>Meteor.isServer</code></a> so that your code can alter its behavior depending on whether it's running on the client or the server.</p>
<p>CSS and HTML files outside special directories are loaded on the client only, and cannot be used from server code.</p>
<h3 id="examplefilestructure">Example File Structure</h3>
<p>The file structure of your Meteor app is very flexible. Here is an example layout that takes advantage of some of the special folders mentioned above.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">lib/                      <span class="hljs-comment"># common code like collections and utilities</span>
lib/methods.js            <span class="hljs-comment"># Meteor.methods definitions</span>
lib/constants.js          <span class="hljs-comment"># constants used in the rest of the code</span>

client/compatibility      <span class="hljs-comment"># legacy libraries that expect to be global</span>
client/lib/               <span class="hljs-comment"># code for the client to be loaded first</span>
client/lib/helpers.js     <span class="hljs-comment"># useful helpers for your client code</span>
client/body.html          <span class="hljs-comment"># content that goes in the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML</span>
client/head.html          <span class="hljs-comment"># content for &lt;head&gt; of your HTML: &lt;meta&gt; tags, etc</span>
client/style.css          <span class="hljs-comment"># some CSS code</span>
client/&lt;feature&gt;.html     <span class="hljs-comment"># HTML templates related to a certain feature</span>
client/&lt;feature&gt;.js       <span class="hljs-comment"># JavaScript code related to a certain feature</span>

server/lib/permissions.js <span class="hljs-comment"># sensitive permissions code used by your server</span>
server/publications.js    <span class="hljs-comment"># Meteor.publish definitions</span>

public/favicon.ico        <span class="hljs-comment"># app icon</span>

settings.json             <span class="hljs-comment"># configuration data to be passed to meteor --settings</span>
mobile-config.js          <span class="hljs-comment"># define icons and metadata for Android/iOS</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also model your directory structure after the example apps. Run <code>meteor create --example todos</code> and explore the directories to see where all the files in a real app could go.</p>
<h3 id="fileloadorder">File Load Order</h3>
<p>It is best to write your application in such a way that it is insensitive to the order in which files are loaded, for example by using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_startup">Meteor.startup</a>, or by moving load order sensitive code into <a href="http://localhost:3000/#usingpackages">packages</a>, which can explicitly control both the load order of their contents and their load order with respect to other packages. However, sometimes load order dependencies in your application are unavoidable.</p>
<p>There are several load ordering rules. They are <em>applied sequentially</em> to all applicable files in the application, in the priority given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML template files are <em>always</em> loaded before everything else</li>
<li>Files beginning with <code>main.</code> are loaded last</li>
<li>Files inside <em>any</em> <code>lib/</code> directory are loaded next</li>
<li>Files with deeper paths are loaded next</li>
<li>Files are then loaded in alphabetical order of the entire path</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="hljs js">nav.html
main.html
client/lib/methods.js
client/lib/styles.js
lib/feature/styles.js
lib/collections.js
client/feature-y.js
feature-x.js
client/main.js
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the files above are arranged in the correct load order. <code>main.html</code> is loaded second because HTML templates are always loaded first, even if it begins with <code>main.</code>, since rule 1 has priority over rule 2. However, it will be loaded after <code>nav.html</code> because rule 2 has priority over rule 5.</p>
<p><code>client/lib/styles.js</code> and <code>lib/feature/styles.js</code> have identical load order up to rule 4; however, since <code>client</code> comes before <code>lib</code> alphabetically, it will be loaded first.</p>
<h3 id="organizingyourproject">Organizing Your Project</h3>
<p>There are three main ways to organize your files into features or components. Let's say we have two types of objects in our project: <strong>apples</strong> and <strong>oranges</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="method1rootlevelfolders">Method 1: Root-Level Folders</h4>
<p>Since the special <code>client</code>, <code>server</code>, and <code>lib</code> directories work if they are anywhere in the path, you can use top-level folders to organize code into modules:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">apples/lib/               <span class="hljs-comment"># code for apple-related features</span>
apples/client/
apples/server/

oranges/lib/              <span class="hljs-comment"># code for orange-related features</span>
oranges/client/
oranges/server/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="method2foldersinsideclientandserver">Method 2: Folders inside client/ and server/</h4>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">lib/apples/               <span class="hljs-comment"># common code for apples</span>
lib/oranges/              <span class="hljs-comment"># and oranges</span>

client/apples/            <span class="hljs-comment"># client code for apples</span>
client/oranges/           <span class="hljs-comment"># and oranges</span>

server/apples/            <span class="hljs-comment"># server code for apples</span>
server/oranges/           <span class="hljs-comment"># and oranges</span>
</code></pre>
<h4 id="method3packages">Method 3: Packages</h4>
<p>This is the ultimate in code separation, modularity, and reusability. If you put the code for each feature in a separate package, the code for one feature won't be able to access the code for the other feature except through exports, making every dependency explicit. This also allows for the easiest independent testing of features. You can also publish the packages and use them in multiple apps with <code>meteor add</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">packages/apples/package.js     <span class="hljs-comment"># files, dependencies, exports for apple feature</span>
packages/apples/&lt;anything&gt;.js  <span class="hljs-comment"># file loading is controlled by package.js</span>

packages/oranges/package.js    <span class="hljs-comment"># files, dependencies, exports for orange feature</span>
packages/oranges/&lt;anything&gt;.js <span class="hljs-comment"># file loading is controlled by package.js</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dataandsecurity">Data and security</h2>
<p>Meteor makes writing distributed client code as simple as talking to a local database. It's a clean, simple, and secure approach that removes the need to implement individual RPC endpoints, manually cache data on the client to avoid slow roundtrips to the server, and carefully orchestrate invalidation messages to every client as data changes.</p>
<p>In Meteor, the client and server share the same database API. The same exact application code &mdash; like validators and computed properties &mdash; can often run in both places. But while code running on the server has direct access to the database, code running on the client does <em>not</em>. This distinction is the basis for Meteor's data security model.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>By default, a new Meteor app includes the <code>autopublish</code> and <code>insecure</code> packages, which together mimic the effect of each client having full read/write access to the server's database. These are useful prototyping tools, but typically not appropriate for production applications. When you're ready, just remove the packages.</p>
</div>
<p>Every Meteor client includes an in-memory database cache. To manage the client cache, the server <em>publishes</em> sets of JSON documents, and the client <em>subscribes</em> to those sets. As documents in a set change, the server patches each client's cache.</p>
<p>Today most Meteor apps use MongoDB as their database because it is the best supported, though support for other databases is coming in the future. The <a href="http://localhost:3000/#mongo_collection"><code>Mongo.Collection</code></a> class is used to declare Mongo collections and to manipulate them. Thanks to <code>minimongo</code>, Meteor's client-side Mongo emulator, <code>Mongo.Collection</code> can be used from both client and server code.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// declare collections</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// this code should be included in both the client and the server</span>
Rooms = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Mongo.Collection(<span class="hljs-string">"rooms"</span>);
Messages = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Mongo.Collection(<span class="hljs-string">"messages"</span>);
Parties = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Mongo.Collection(<span class="hljs-string">"parties"</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">// server: populate collections with some initial documents</span>
Rooms.insert({name: <span class="hljs-string">"Conference Room A"</span>});
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myRooms = Rooms.find({}).fetch();
Messages.insert({text: <span class="hljs-string">"Hello world"</span>, room: myRooms[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]._id});
Parties.insert({name: <span class="hljs-string">"Super Bowl Party"</span>});
</code></pre>
<p>Each document set is defined by a publish function on the server. The publish function runs each time a new client subscribes to a document set. The data in a document set can come from anywhere, but the common case is to publish a database query.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// server: publish all room documents</span>
Meteor.publish(<span class="hljs-string">"all-rooms"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Rooms.find(); <span class="hljs-comment">// everything</span>
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// server: publish all messages for a given room</span>
Meteor.publish(<span class="hljs-string">"messages"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(roomId)</span> </span>{
  check(roomId, <span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Messages.find({room: roomId});
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// server: publish the set of parties the logged-in user can see.</span>
Meteor.publish(<span class="hljs-string">"parties"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Parties.find({$or: [{<span class="hljs-string">"public"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>},
                             {invited: <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.userId},
                             {owner: <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.userId}]});
});
</code></pre>
<p>Publish functions can provide different results to each client. In the last example, a logged in user can only see <code>Party</code> documents that are public, that the user owns, or that the user has been invited to.</p>
<p>Once subscribed, the client uses its cache as a fast local database, dramatically simplifying client code. Reads never require a costly round trip to the server. And they're limited to the contents of the cache: a query for every document in a collection on a client will only return documents the server is publishing to that client.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// client: start a parties subscription</span>
Meteor.subscribe(<span class="hljs-string">"parties"</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">// client: return array of Parties this client can read</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Parties.find().fetch(); <span class="hljs-comment">// synchronous!</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Sophisticated clients can turn subscriptions on and off to control how much data is kept in the cache and manage network traffic. When a subscription is turned off, all its documents are removed from the cache unless the same document is also provided by another active subscription.</p>
<p>When the client <em>changes</em> one or more documents, it sends a message to the server requesting the change. The server checks the proposed change against a set of allow/deny rules you write as JavaScript functions. The server only accepts the change if all the rules pass.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// server: don't allow client to insert a party</span>
Parties.allow({
  insert: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(userId, party)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
  }
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// client: this will fail</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> party = { ... };
Parties.insert(party);
</code></pre>
<p>If the server accepts the change, it applies the change to the database and automatically propagates the change to other clients subscribed to the affected documents. If not, the update fails, the server's database remains untouched, and no other client sees the update.</p>
<p>Meteor has a cute trick, though. When a client issues a write to the server, it also updates its local cache immediately, without waiting for the server's response. This means the screen will redraw right away. If the server accepted the update &mdash; what ought to happen most of the time in a properly behaving client &mdash; then the client got a jump on the change and didn't have to wait for the round trip to update its own screen. If the server rejects the change, Meteor patches up the client's cache with the server's result.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, these techniques accomplish latency compensation. Clients hold a fresh copy of the data they need, and never need to wait for a roundtrip to the server. And when clients modify data, those modifications can run locally without waiting for the confirmation from the server, while still giving the server final say over the requested change.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>The current release of Meteor supports MongoDB, the popular document database, and the examples in this section use the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Manual">MongoDB API</a>. Future releases will include support for other databases.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="dataandsecurity-authentication">Authentication and user accounts</h3>
<p>Meteor includes <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_api">Meteor Accounts</a>, a state-of-the-art authentication system. It features secure password login using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> algorithm, and integration with external services including Facebook, GitHub, Google, Meetup, Twitter, and Weibo. Meteor Accounts defines a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_users"><code>Meteor.users</code></a> collection where developers can store application-specific user data.</p>
<p>Meteor also includes pre-built forms for common tasks like login, signup, password change, and password reset emails. You can add <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accountsui">Accounts UI</a> to your app with just one line of code. The <code>accounts-ui</code> package even provides a configuration wizard that walks you through the steps to set up the external login services you're using in your app.</p>
<h3 id="dataandsecurity-validation">Input validation</h3>
<p>Meteor allows your methods and publish functions to take arguments of any <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> type. (In fact, Meteor's wire protocol supports <a href="http://localhost:3000/#ejson">EJSON</a>, an extension of JSON which also supports other common types like dates and binary buffers.) JavaScript's dynamic typing means you don't need to declare precise types of every variable in your app, but it's usually helpful to ensure that the arguments that clients are passing to your methods and publish functions are of the type that you expect.</p>
<p>Meteor provides a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#check_package">lightweight library</a> for checking that arguments and other values are the type you expect them to be. Simply start your functions with statements like <code>check(username, String)</code> or <code>check(office, {building: String, room: Number})</code>. The <code>check</code> call will throw an error if its argument is of an unexpected type.</p>
<p>Meteor also provides an easy way to make sure that all of your methods and publish functions validate all of their arguments. Just run <code>meteor add <a href="http://localhost:3000/#auditargumentchecks">audit-argument-checks</a></code> and any method or publish function which skips <code>check</code>ing any of its arguments will fail with an exception.</p>
<h2 id="reactivity">Reactivity</h2>
<p>Meteor embraces the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming">reactive programming</a>. This means that you can write your code in a simple imperative style, and the result will be automatically recalculated whenever data changes that your code depends on.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Tracker.autorun(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

});

<p>This example (taken from a chat room client) sets up a data subscription based on the session variable <code>currentRoomId</code>. If the value of <code>Session.get("currentRoomId")</code> changes for any reason, the function will be automatically re-run, setting up a new subscription that replaces the old one.</p>
<p>This automatic recomputation is achieved by a cooperation between <code>Session</code> and <code>Tracker.autorun</code>. <code>Tracker.autorun</code> performs an arbitrary "reactive computation" inside of which data dependencies are tracked, and it will re-run its function argument as necessary. Data providers like <code>Session</code>, on the other hand, make note of the computation they are called from and what data was requested, and they are prepared to send an invalidation signal to the computation when the data changes.</p>
<p>This simple pattern (reactive computation + reactive data source) has wide applicability. Above, the programmer is saved from writing unsubscribe/resubscribe calls and making sure they are called at the right time. In general, Meteor can eliminate whole classes of data propagation code which would otherwise clog up your application with error-prone logic.</p>
<p>These Meteor functions run your code as a reactive computation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#livehtmltemplates">Templates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#blaze_render"><code>Blaze.render</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#blaze_renderwithdata"><code>Blaze.renderWithData</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>And the reactive data sources that can trigger changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#session"><code>Session</code></a> variables</li>
<li>Database queries on <a href="http://localhost:3000/#find">Collections</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_status"><code>Meteor.status</code></a></li>
<li>The <code>ready()</code> method on a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_subscribe">subscription handle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_user"><code>Meteor.user</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_userid"><code>Meteor.userId</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_loggingin"><code>Meteor.loggingIn</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following functions which return an object with a <code>stop</code> method, if called from a reactive computation, are stopped when the computation is rerun or stopped:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a> (nested)</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_subscribe"><code>Meteor.subscribe</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:3000/#observe"><code>observe()</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#observe_changes"><code>observeChanges()</code></a> on cursors</li>
</ul>
<p>Meteor's <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/packages/tracker/tracker.js">implementation</a> is a package called <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker"><code>Tracker</code></a> that is fairly short and straightforward. You can use it yourself to implement new reactive data sources.</p>
<h2 id="livehtmltemplates">Live HTML templates</h2>
<p>HTML templating is central to web applications. With Blaze, Meteor's live page update technology, you can render your HTML <em>reactively</em>, meaning that it will update automatically to track changes in the data used to generate it.</p>
<p>Meteor makes it easy to use your favorite HTML templating language along with Meteor's live page update technology. Just write your template as you normally would, and Meteor will take care of making it update in realtime.</p>
<p>Meteor ships with a templating language called <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md">Spacebars</a>, inspired by <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. It shares some of the spirit and syntax of Handlebars, but it has been tailored to produce reactive Meteor templates when compiled.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Today, the only templating system that ships with Meteor is Spacebars, though our community has created packages for other languages such as <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/mquandalle/jade">Jade</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>To define templates, create a file in your project with the <code>.html</code> extension. In the file, make a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and give it a <code>name</code> attribute. Put the template contents inside the tag. Meteor will precompile the template, ship it down to the client, and make it available as on the global <code>Template</code> object.</p>
<p>When your app is loaded, it automatically renders the special template called <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, which is written using the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element instead of a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>. You insert a template inside another template by using the <code>{{&gt; inclusion}}</code> operator.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get data into templates is by defining helper functions in JavaScript. Define helpers with the <code>Template.templateName.helpers({ ... })</code> function. Putting it all together:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- in myapp.html --&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h1</span>&gt;</span>Today's weather!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h1</span>&gt;</span>
  {{&gt; forecast}}

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">template</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// in client/myapp.js: reactive helper function</span>
Template.forecast.helpers({
  prediction: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Session.get(<span class="hljs-string">"weather"</span>);
  }
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// in the JavaScript console</span>
&gt; Session.set(<span class="hljs-string">"weather"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"cloudy"</span>);
&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.body.innerHTML
 =&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"&lt;h1&gt;Today's weather!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div&gt;It'll be cloudy tonight&lt;/div&gt;"</span>

&gt; Session.set(<span class="hljs-string">"weather"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"cool and dry"</span>);
&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.body.innerHTML
 =&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"&lt;h1&gt;Today's weather!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div&gt;It'll be cool and dry tonight&lt;/div&gt;"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To iterate over an array or database cursor, use <code>{{#each}}</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- in myapp.html --&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">template</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"players"</span>&gt;</span>
  {{#each topScorers}}
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>{{name}}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
  {{/each}}
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">template</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// in myapp.js</span>
Template.players.helpers({
  topScorers: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Users.find({score: {$gt: <span class="hljs-number">100</span>}}, {sort: {score: -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>}});
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the data is coming from a database query. When the database cursor is passed to <code>{{#each}}</code>, it will wire up all of the machinery to efficiently add and move DOM nodes as new results enter the query.</p>
<p>Helpers can take arguments, and they receive the current template context data in <code>this</code>. Note that some block helpers change the current context (notably <code>{{#each}}</code> and <code>{{#with}}</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// in a JavaScript file</span>
Template.players.helpers({
  leagueIs: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(league)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.league === league;
  }
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- in a HTML file --&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">template</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">name</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"players"</span>&gt;</span>
  {{#each topScorers}}
    {{#if leagueIs "junior"}}
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>Junior: {{name}}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
    {{/if}}
    {{#if leagueIs "senior"}}
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>Senior: {{name}}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
    {{/if}}
  {{/each}}
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">template</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Helpers can also be used to pass in constant data.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Works fine with {{#each sections}}</span>
Template.report.helpers({
  sections: [<span class="hljs-string">"Situation"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Complication"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Resolution"</span>]
});
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can use the <code>events</code> function on a template to attach event handlers. The object passed into <code>events</code> is documented at <a href="http://localhost:3000/#eventmaps">Event Maps</a>. The <code>this</code> argument to the event handler will be the data context of the element that triggered the event.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- myapp.html --&gt;</span>

<h2 id="usingpackages">Using packages</h2>
<p>All of the functionality you've read about so far is implemented in standard Meteor packages. This is possible thanks to Meteor's unusually powerful isomorphic package and build system. Isomorphic means the same packages work in the web browser, in mobile apps, and on the server. Packages can also contain plugins that extend the build process, such as <code>coffeescript</code> (<a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> compilation) or <code>templating</code> (compiling HTML templates).</p>
<p>Anyone can publish a Meteor package, and thousands of community-written packages have been published to date. The easiest way to browse these packages is <a href="http://www.atmospherejs.com">Atmosphere</a>, by Percolate Studio. You can also use the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorsearch"><code>meteor search</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorshow"><code>meteor show</code></a> commands.</p>
<p>You can add packages to your project with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteoradd"><code>meteor add</code></a> and remove them with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorremove"><code>meteor remove</code></a>. Additionally, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorlist"><code>meteor list</code></a> will tell you what packages your project is using, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorupdate"><code>meteor update</code></a> will update them to the newest versions when possible.</p>
<p>By default all apps include the <code>meteor-platform</code> package. This automatically pulls in the packages that make up the core Meteor stack. If you want to build your own custom stack, just remove <code>meteor-platform</code> from your app and add back in whichever of the standard packages you want to keep.</p>
<p>Meteor uses a single-loading packaging system, meaning that it loads just one version of every package. Before adding or upgrading to a particular version of a package, Meteor uses a constraint solver to check if doing so will cause other packages to break. By default, Meteor will choose conservatively. When adding transitive dependencies (packages that other packages, but not the application itself) depend on, Meteor will try to choose the earlier version.</p>
<p>In addition to the packages in the official Meteor release being used by your app, <code>meteor list</code> and <code>meteor add</code> also search the <code>packages</code> directory at the top of your app. You can also use the <code>packages</code> directory to break your app into subpackages for your convenience, or to test packages that you might want to publish. See <a href="http://localhost:3000/#writingpackages">Writing Packages</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="namespacing">Namespacing</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meteor's namespacing support makes it easy to write large applications in JavaScript. Each package that you use in your app exists in its own separate namespace, meaning that it sees only its own global variables and any variables provided by the packages that it specifically uses. Here's how it works.</p>
<p>When you declare a top-level variable, you have a choice. You can make the variable File Scope or Package Scope.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// File Scope. This variable will be visible only inside this</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// one file. Other files in this app or package won't see it.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> alicePerson = {name: <span class="hljs-string">"alice"</span>};

<span class="hljs-comment">// Package Scope. This variable is visible to every file inside</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// of this package or app. The difference is that 'var' is</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// omitted.</span>
bobPerson = {name: <span class="hljs-string">"bob"</span>};
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this is just the normal JavaScript syntax for declaring a variable that is local or global. Meteor scans your source code for global variable assignments and generates a wrapper that makes sure that your globals don't escape their appropriate namespace.</p>
<p>In addition to File Scope and Package Scope, there are also Exports. An export is a variable that a package makes available to you when you use it. For example, the <code>email</code> package exports the <code>Email</code> variable. If your app uses the <code>email</code> package (and <em>only</em> if it uses the <code>email</code> package!) then your app can see <code>Email</code> and you can call <code>Email.send</code>. Most packages have only one export, but some packages might have two or three (for example, a package that provides several classes that work together).</p>
<p>You see only the exports of the packages that you use directly. If you use package A, and package A uses package B, then you only see package A's exports. Package B's exports don't "leak" into your namespace just because you used package A. This keeps each namespace nice and tidy. Each app or package only sees their own globals plus the APIs of the packages that they specifically asked for.</p>
<p>When debugging your app, your browser's JavaScript console behaves as if it were attached to your app's namespace. You see your app's globals and the exports of the packages that your app uses directly. You don't see the variables from inside those packages, and you don't see the exports of your transitive dependencies (packages that aren't used directly by your app, but that are used by packages that are used by your app).</p>
<p>If you want to look inside packages from inside your in-browser debugger, you've got two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set a breakpoint inside package code. While stopped on that breakpoint, the console will be in the package's namespace. You'll see the package's package-scope variables, imports, and also any file-scope variables for the file you're stopped in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a package <code>foo</code> is included in your app, regardless of whether your app uses it directly, its exports are available in <code>Package.foo</code>. For example, if the <code>email</code> package is loaded, then you can access <code>Package.email.Email.send</code> even from namespaces that don't use the <code>email</code> package directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When declaring functions, keep in mind that <code>function x () {}</code> is just shorthand for <code>var x = function x () {}</code> in JavaScript. Consider these examples:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// This is the same as 'var x = function x () ...'. So x() is</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// file-scope and can be called only from within this one file.</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">x</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ ... }

<span class="hljs-comment">// No 'var', so x() is package-scope and can be called from</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// any file inside this app or package.</span>
x = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ ... }
</code></pre>
<div class="note">
<p>Technically speaking, globals in an app (as opposed to in a package) are actually true globals. They can't be captured in a scope that is private to the app code, because that would mean that they wouldn't be visible in the console during debugging! This means that app globals actually end up being visible in packages. That should never be a problem for properly written package code (since the app globals will still be properly shadowed by declarations in the packages). You certainly shouldn't depend on this quirk, and in the future Meteor may check for it and throw an error if you do.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="deploying">Deploying</h2>
<p>Meteor is a full application server. We include everything you need to deploy your application on the internet: you just provide the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
<h3 class="nosection">Running on Meteor's infrastructure</h3>
<p>The easiest way to deploy your application is to use <code>meteor deploy</code>. We provide it because it's what, personally, we've always wanted: an easy way to take an app idea, flesh it out over a weekend, and put it out there for the world to use, with nothing getting in the way of creativity.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>meteor deploy myapp.meteor.com
</code></pre>
<p>Your application is now available at myapp.meteor.com. If this is the first time deploying to this hostname, Meteor creates a fresh empty database for your application. If you want to deploy an update, Meteor will preserve the existing data and just refresh the code.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to your own domain. Just set up the hostname you want to use as a CNAME to <code>origin.meteor.com</code>, then deploy to that name.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>meteor deploy www.myapp.com
</code></pre>
<p>We provide this as a free service so you can try Meteor. It is also helpful for quickly putting up internal betas, demos, and so on. For more information, see <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteordeploy">meteor deploy</a>.</p>
<h3 class="nosection">Running on your own infrastructure</h3>
<p>You can also run your application on your own infrastructure or any hosting provider that can run Node.js apps.</p>
<p>To get started, run</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>meteor build my_directory
</code></pre>
<p>This command will generate a fully-contained Node.js application in the form of a tarball. To run this application, you need to provide Node.js 0.10 and a MongoDB server. (The current release of Meteor has been tested with Node 0.10.36.) You can then run the application by invoking node, specifying the HTTP port for the application to listen on, and the MongoDB endpoint.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> my_directory
$ (<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> programs/server &amp;&amp; npm install)
$ PORT=<span class="hljs-number">3000</span> MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:<span class="hljs-number">27017</span>/myapp node main.js
</code></pre>
<p>Some packages might require other environment variables. For example, the <code>email</code> package requires a <code>MAIL_URL</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="writingpackages">Writing packages</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing Meteor packages is easy. To initialize a meteor package, run <code>meteor create --package username:packagename</code>, where <code>username</code> is your Meteor Developer username. This will create a package from scratch and prefill the directory with a package.js control file and some javascript. By default, Meteor will take the package name from the name of the directory that contains the package.js file. Don't forget to run <code>meteor add [packagename]</code>, even if the package is internal to the app, in order to use it.</p>
<p>Meteor promises repeatable builds for both packages and applications. This means that, if you built your package on a machine, then checked the code into a repository and checked it out elsewhere, you should get the same result. In your package directory, you will find an automatically generated <code>.versions</code> file. This file specifies the versions of all packages used to build your package and is part of the source. Check it into version control to ensure repeatable builds across machines.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>Sometimes, packages do not just stand on their own, but function in the context of an app (specifically, packages in the packages directory of an app). In that case, the app's context will take precedence. Rather than using the <code>.versions</code> file as a guide, we will build the package with the same dependencies as used by the app (we think that, in practice, it would be confusing to find your local packages built with different versions of things).</p>
</div>
<p>Meteor uses extended semver versioning for its packages: that means that the version number has three parts separated by dots: major version, minor version and patch version (for example: 1.2.3) with an optional pre-release version. You can read more about it on <a href="http://www.semver.org">semver.org</a>. Additionally, because some meteor packages wrap external libraries, Meteor supports the convention of using <code>_</code> to denote a wrap number.</p>
<p>You can read more about <a href="http://localhost:3000/#packagejs"><code>package.js</code></a> files in the API section.</p>
<p>A word on testing: since testing is an important part of the development process, there are two common ways to test a package:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integration tests (putting a package directly into an application, and writing tests against the application) is the most common way to test a package. After creating your package, add it to your app's /packages directory and run <code>meteor add</code>. This will add your package to your app as a local package. You can then test and run your app as usual. Meteor will detect and respond to changes to your local package, just as it does to your app files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit tests are run with the command <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteortestpackages"><code>meteor test-packages package-name</code></a>. As described in the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#packagejs"><code>package.js</code></a> section, you can use the <code>package.js</code> file to specify where your unit tests are located. If you have a repository that contains only the package source, you can test your package by specifying the path to the package directory (which must contain a slash), such as <code>meteor test-packages ./</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To publish a package, run <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteorpublish"><code>meteor publish</code></a> from the package directory. There are some extra restrictions on published packages: they must contain a version (Meteor packages are versioned using strict <a href="http://www.semver.org">semver</a> versioning) and their names must be prefixed with the username of the author and a colon, like so: <code>iron:router</code>. This namespacing allows for more descriptive and on-topic package names.</p>
<h1 id="api">The Meteor API</h1>
<p>Your JavaScript code can run in two environments: the <em>client</em> (browser), and the <em>server</em> (a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> container on a server).

<p>Alternatively, a publish function can directly control its published record set by calling the functions <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_added"><code>added</code></a> (to add a new document to the published record set), <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_changed"><code>changed</code></a> (to change or clear some fields on a document already in the published record set), and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_removed"><code>removed</code></a> (to remove documents from the published record set). These methods are provided by <code>this</code> in your publish function.</p>
<p>If a publish function does not return a cursor or array of cursors, it is assumed to be using the low-level <code>added</code>/<code>changed</code>/<code>removed</code> interface, and it <strong>must also call <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_ready"><code>ready</code></a> once the initial record set is complete</strong>.</p>

<p>The <code>onReady</code> callback is called with no arguments when the server <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_ready">marks the subscription as ready</a>. The <code>onStop</code> callback is called with a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_error"><code>Meteor.Error</code></a> if the subscription fails or is terminated by the server. If the subscription is stopped by calling <code>stop</code> on the subscription handle or inside the publication, <code>onStop</code> is called with no arguments.</p>
<p><code>Meteor.subscribe</code> returns a subscription handle, which is an object with the following properties:</p>
<dl class="callbacks">
<dt><span class="name">stop()</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cancel the subscription. This will typically result in the server directing the client to remove the subscription's data from the client's cache.</p>

<dt><span class="name">ready()</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>True if the server has <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_ready">marked the subscription as ready</a>. A reactive data source.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">subscriptionId</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>id</code> of the subscription this handle is for. When you run <code>Meteor.subscribe</code> inside of <code>Tracker.autorun</code>, the handles you get will always have the same <code>subscriptionId</code> field. You can use this to deduplicate subscription handles if you are storing them in some data structure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you call <code>Meteor.subscribe</code> within a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#reactivity">reactive computation</a>, for example using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a>, the subscription will automatically be cancelled when the computation is invalidated or stopped; it's not necessary to call <code>stop</code> on subscriptions made from inside <code>autorun</code>. However, if the next iteration of your run function subscribes to the same record set (same name and parameters), Meteor is smart enough to skip a wasteful unsubscribe/resubscribe. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Tracker.autorun(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  Meteor.subscribe(<span class="hljs-string">"chat"</span>, {room: Session.get(<span class="hljs-string">"current-room"</span>)});
  Meteor.subscribe(<span class="hljs-string">"privateMessages"</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>This subscribes you to the chat messages in the current room and to your private messages. When you change rooms by calling <code>Session.set("current-room", "new-room")</code>, Meteor will subscribe to the new room's chat messages, unsubscribe from the original room's chat messages, and continue to stay subscribed to your private messages.</p>
<p>If more than one subscription sends conflicting values for a field (same collection name, document ID, and field name), then the value on the client will be one of the published values, chosen arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Calling <code>methods</code> on the server defines functions that can be called remotely by clients. They should return an <a href="http://localhost:3000/#ejson">EJSON</a>-able value or throw an exception. Inside your method invocation, <code>this</code> is bound to a method invocation object, which provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>isSimulation</code>: a boolean value, true if this invocation is a stub.</li>
<li><code>unblock</code>: when called, allows the next method from this client to begin running.</li>
<li><code>userId</code>: the id of the current user.</li>
<li><code>setUserId</code>: a function that associates the current client with a user.</li>
<li><code>connection</code>: on the server, the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_onconnection">connection</a> this method call was received on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling <code>methods</code> on the client defines <em>stub</em> functions associated with server methods of the same name. You don't have to define a stub for your method if you don't want to. In that case, method calls are just like remote procedure calls in other systems, and you'll have to wait for the results from the server.</p>
<p>If you do define a stub, when a client invokes a server method it will also run its stub in parallel. On the client, the return value of a stub is ignored. Stubs are run for their side-effects: they are intended to <em>simulate</em> the result of what the server's method will do, but without waiting for the round trip delay. If a stub throws an exception it will be logged to the console.</p>
<p>You use methods all the time, because the database mutators (<a href="http://localhost:3000/#insert"><code>insert</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#update"><code>update</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#remove"><code>remove</code></a>) are implemented as methods. When you call any of these functions on the client, you're invoking their stub version that update the local cache, and sending the same write request to the server. When the server responds, the client updates the local cache with the writes that actually occurred on the server.</p>
<p>You don't have to put all your method definitions into a single <code>Meteor.methods</code> call; you may call it multiple times, as long as each method has a unique name.</p>
<p>Since methods usually expect particular types as arguments, use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#check"><code>check</code></a> liberally to ensure your method arguments have the correct <a href="http://localhost:3000/#matchpatterns">types and structure</a>.</p>
<p>If a client calls a method and is disconnected before it receives a response, it will re-call the method when it reconnects. This means that a client may call a method multiple times when it only means to call it once. If this behavior is problematic for your method, consider attaching a unique ID to each method call on the client, and checking on the server whether a call with this ID has already been made.</p>

<p>If you want to return an error from a method, throw an exception. Methods can throw any kind of exception. But <code>Meteor.Error</code> is the only kind of error that a server will send to the client. If a method function throws a different exception, then it will be mapped to a sanitized version on the wire. Specifically, if the <code>sanitizedError</code> field on the thrown error is set to a <code>Meteor.Error</code>, then that error will be sent to the client. Otherwise, if no sanitized version is available, the client gets <code>Meteor.Error(500, 'Internal server error')</code>.</p>

<dt><span class="name">asyncCallback</span> <span class="type">Function</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional callback, which is called asynchronously with the error or result after the method is complete. If not provided, the method runs synchronously if possible (see below).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>This is how to invoke a method. It will run the method on the server. If a stub is available, it will also run the stub on the client. (See also <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_apply"><code>Meteor.apply</code></a>, which is identical to <code>Meteor.call</code> except that you specify the parameters as an array instead of as separate arguments and you can specify a few options controlling how the method is executed.)</p>
<p>If you include a callback function as the last argument (which can't be an argument to the method, since functions aren't serializable), the method will run asynchronously: it will return nothing in particular and will not throw an exception. When the method is complete (which may or may not happen before <code>Meteor.call</code> returns), the callback will be called with two arguments: <code>error</code> and <code>result</code>. If an error was thrown, then <code>error</code> will be the exception object. Otherwise, <code>error</code> will be undefined and the return value (possibly undefined) will be in <code>result</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// async call</span>
Meteor.call(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(error, result)</span> </span>{ ... } );
</code></pre>
<p>If you do not pass a callback on the server, the method invocation will block until the method is complete. It will eventually return the return value of the method, or it will throw an exception if the method threw an exception. (Possibly mapped to 500 Server Error if the exception happened remotely and it was not a <code>Meteor.Error</code> exception.)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">// sync <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">call</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> result = Meteor.<span class="hljs-keyword">call</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>On the client, if you do not pass a callback and you are not inside a stub, <code>call</code> will return <code>undefined</code>, and you will have no way to get the return value of the method. That is because the client doesn't have fibers, so there is not actually any way it can block on the remote execution of a method.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are inside a stub on the client and call another method, the other method is not executed (no RPC is generated, nothing "real" happens). If that other method has a stub, that stub stands in for the method and is executed. The method call's return value is the return value of the stub function. The client has no problem executing a stub synchronously, and that is why it's okay for the client to use the synchronous <code>Meteor.call</code> form from inside a method body, as described earlier.</p>
<p>Meteor tracks the database writes performed by methods, both on the client and the server, and does not invoke <code>asyncCallback</code> until all of the server's writes replace the stub's writes in the local cache. In some cases, there can be a lag between the method's return value being available and the writes being visible: for example, if another method still outstanding wrote to the same document, the local cache may not be up to date until the other method finishes as well. If you want to process the method's result as soon as it arrives from the server, even if the method's writes are not available yet, you can specify an <code>onResultReceived</code> callback to <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_apply"><code>Meteor.apply</code></a>.</p>

<p>Meteor methods and publish functions take arbitrary <a href="http://localhost:3000/#ejson">EJSON</a> types as arguments, but most arguments are expected to be of a particular type. <code>check</code> is a lightweight function for checking that arguments and other values are of the expected type. For example:</p>

<p>If the match fails, <code>check</code> throws a <code>Match.Error</code> describing how it failed.

<p>By default, clients open a connection to the server from which they're loaded. When you call <code>Meteor.subscribe</code>, <code>Meteor.status</code>, <code>Meteor.call</code>, and <code>Meteor.apply</code>, you are using a connection back to that default server.</p>
<h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>
<p>Meteor stores data in <em>collections</em>. To get started, declare a collection with <code>new Mongo.Collection</code>.</p>
<div class="api new-api-box">

<dt><span class="name">transform</span> <span class="type">Function</span></dt>

<p>An optional transformation function. Documents will be passed through this function before being returned from <code>fetch</code> or <code>findOne</code>, and before being passed to callbacks of <code>observe</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>allow</code>, and <code>deny</code>. Transforms are <em>not</em> applied for the callbacks of <code>observeChanges</code> or to cursors returned from publish functions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Calling this function is analogous to declaring a model in a traditional ORM (Object-Relation Mapper)-centric framework. It sets up a <em>collection</em> (a storage space for records, or "documents") that can be used to store a particular type of information, like users, posts, scores, todo items, or whatever matters to your application. Each document is a EJSON object. It includes an <code>_id</code> property whose value is unique in the collection, which Meteor will set when you first create the document.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// common code on client and server declares a DDP-managed mongo</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// collection.</span>
Chatrooms = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Mongo.Collection(<span class="hljs-string">"chatrooms"</span>);
Messages = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Mongo.Collection(<span class="hljs-string">"messages"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The function returns an object with methods to <a href="http://localhost:3000/#insert"><code>insert</code></a> documents in the collection, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#update"><code>update</code></a> their properties, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#remove"><code>remove</code></a> them, and to <a href="http://localhost:3000/#find"><code>find</code></a> the documents in the collection that match arbitrary criteria. The way these methods work is compatible with the popular Mongo database API. The same database API works on both the client and the server (see below).</p>
<pre><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-comment">// return array of my messages</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myMessages = Messages.find({userId: Session.<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myUserId'</span>)}).fetch();

Messages.update(myMessages[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]._id, {$<span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>: {important: <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>}});
</code></pre>
<p>If you pass a <code>name</code> when you create the collection, then you are declaring a persistent collection &mdash; one that is stored on the server and seen by all users. Client code and server code can both access the same collection using the same API.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you pass a <code>name</code>, here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the server (if you do not specify a <code>connection</code>), a collection with that name is created on a backend Mongo server. When you call methods on that collection on the server, they translate directly into normal Mongo operations (after checking that they match your <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow">access control rules</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the client (and on the server if you specify a <code>connection</code>), a Minimongo instance is created. Minimongo is essentially an in-memory, non-persistent implementation of Mongo in pure JavaScript. It serves as a local cache that stores just the subset of the database that this client is working with. Queries (<a href="http://localhost:3000/#find"><code>find</code></a>) on these collections are served directly out of this cache, without talking to the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you write to the database on the client (<a href="http://localhost:3000/#insert"><code>insert</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#update"><code>update</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#remove"><code>remove</code></a>), the command is executed locally immediately, and, simultaneously, it's sent to the server and executed there too. This happens via <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_methods">stubs</a>, because writes are implemented as methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p>When, on the server, you write to a collection which has a specified <code>connection</code> to another server, it sends the corresponding method to the other server and receives the changed values back from it over DDP. Unlike on the client, it does not execute the write locally first.</p>
</div>
<p>If you pass <code>null</code> as the <code>name</code>, then you're creating a local collection. It's not synchronized anywhere; it's just a local scratchpad that supports Mongo-style <a href="http://localhost:3000/#find"><code>find</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#insert"><code>insert</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#update"><code>update</code></a>, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#remove"><code>remove</code></a> operations. (On both the client and the server, this scratchpad is implemented using Minimongo.)</p>
<p>By default, Meteor automatically publishes every document in your collection to each connected client. To turn this behavior off, remove the <code>autopublish</code> package:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>meteor remove autopublish
</code></pre>
<p>and instead call <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_publish"><code>Meteor.publish</code></a> to specify which parts of your collection should be published to which users.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Create a collection called Posts and put a document in it. The</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// document will be immediately visible in the local copy of the</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Generally, you'll assign <code>Mongo.Collection</code> objects in your app to global variables. You can only create one <code>Mongo.Collection</code> object for each underlying Mongo collection.</p>
<p>If you specify a <code>transform</code> option to the <code>Collection</code> or any of its retrieval methods, documents are passed through the <code>transform</code> function before being returned or passed to callbacks. This allows you to add methods or otherwise modify the contents of your collection from their database representation. You can also specify <code>transform</code> on a particular <code>find</code>, <code>findOne</code>, <code>allow</code>, or <code>deny</code> call. Transform functions must return an object and they may not change the value of the document's <code>_id</code> field (though it's OK to leave it out).</p>

<p><code>find</code> returns a cursor. It does not immediately access the database or return documents. Cursors provide <code>fetch</code> to return all matching documents, <code>map</code> and <code>forEach</code> to iterate over all matching documents, and <code>observe</code> and <code>observeChanges</code> to register callbacks when the set of matching documents changes.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>Collection cursors are not query snapshots. If the database changes between calling <code>Collection.find</code> and fetching the results of the cursor, or while fetching results from the cursor, those changes may or may not appear in the result set.</p>

<p>Cursors are a reactive data source. On the client, the first time you retrieve a cursor's documents with <code>fetch</code>, <code>map</code>, or <code>forEach</code> inside a reactive computation (eg, a template or <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>autorun</code></a>), Meteor will register a dependency on the underlying data. Any change to the collection that changes the documents in a cursor will trigger a recomputation. To disable this behavior, pass <code>{reactive: false}</code> as an option to <code>find</code>.</p>
<p>Note that when <code>fields</code> are specified, only changes to the included fields will trigger callbacks in <code>observe</code>, <code>observeChanges</code> and invalidations in reactive computations using this cursor. Careful use of <code>fields</code> allows for more fine-grained reactivity for computations that don't depend on an entire document.</p>

<p>Add a document to the collection. A document is just an object, and its fields can contain any combination of EJSON-compatible datatypes (arrays, objects, numbers, strings, <code>null</code>, true, and false).</p>
<p><code>insert</code> will generate a unique ID for the object you pass, insert it in the database, and return the ID.

<p>On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then <code>insert</code> blocks until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if something went wrong. If you do provide a callback, <code>insert</code> still returns the ID immediately. Once the insert completes (or fails), the callback is called with error and result arguments. In an error case, <code>result</code> is undefined. If the insert is successful, <code>error</code> is undefined and <code>result</code> is the new document ID.</p>
<p>On the client, <code>insert</code> never blocks. If you do not provide a callback and the insert fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to the console. If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function with <code>error</code> and <code>result</code> arguments. In an error case, <code>result</code> is undefined. If the insert is successful, <code>error</code> is undefined and <code>result</code> is the new document ID.</p>

<p>Modify documents that match <code>selector</code> according to <code>modifier</code> (see <a href="http://localhost:3000/#modifiers">modifier documentation</a>).</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>update</code> differs depending on whether it is called by trusted or untrusted code. Trusted code includes server code and method code. Untrusted code includes client-side code such as event handlers and a browser's JavaScript console.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trusted code can modify multiple documents at once by setting <code>multi</code> to true, and can use an arbitrary <a href="http://localhost:3000/#selectors">Mongo selector</a> to find the documents to modify. It bypasses any access control rules set up by <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow"><code>allow</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#deny"><code>deny</code></a>. The number of affected documents will be returned from the <code>update</code> call if you don't pass a callback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Untrusted code can only modify a single document at once, specified by its <code>_id</code>. The modification is allowed only after checking any applicable <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow"><code>allow</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#deny"><code>deny</code></a> rules. The number of affected documents will be returned to the callback. Untrusted code cannot perform upserts, except in insecure mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then <code>update</code> blocks until the database acknowledges the write, or throws an exception if something went wrong. If you do provide a callback, <code>update</code> returns immediately. Once the update completes, the callback is called with a single error argument in the case of failure, or a second argument indicating the number of affected documents if the update was successful.</p>
<p>On the client, <code>update</code> never blocks. If you do not provide a callback and the update fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to the console. If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function with an error argument if there was an error, or a second argument indicating the number of affected documents if the update was successful.</p>
<p>Client example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-comment">// When the givePoints button in the admin dashboard is pressed,</span>

<p>Find all of the documents that match <code>selector</code> and delete them from the collection.</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>remove</code> differs depending on whether it is called by trusted or untrusted code. Trusted code includes server code and method code. Untrusted code includes client-side code such as event handlers and a browser's JavaScript console.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trusted code can use an arbitrary <a href="http://localhost:3000/#selectors">Mongo selector</a> to find the documents to remove, and can remove more than one document at once by passing a selector that matches multiple documents. It bypasses any access control rules set up by <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow"><code>allow</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#deny"><code>deny</code></a>. The number of removed documents will be returned from <code>remove</code> if you don't pass a callback.</p>
<p>As a safety measure, if <code>selector</code> is omitted (or is <code>undefined</code>), no documents will be removed. Set <code>selector</code> to <code>{}</code> if you really want to remove all documents from your collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Untrusted code can only remove a single document at a time, specified by its <code>_id</code>. The document is removed only after checking any applicable <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow"><code>allow</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#deny"><code>deny</code></a> rules. The number of removed documents will be returned to the callback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the server, if you don't provide a callback, then <code>remove</code> blocks until the database acknowledges the write and then returns the number of removed documents, or throws an exception if something went wrong. If you do provide a callback, <code>remove</code> returns immediately. Once the remove completes, the callback is called with a single error argument in the case of failure, or a second argument indicating the number of removed documents if the remove was successful.</p>
<p>On the client, <code>remove</code> never blocks. If you do not provide a callback and the remove fails on the server, then Meteor will log a warning to the console. If you provide a callback, Meteor will call that function with an error argument if there was an error, or a second argument indicating the number of removed documents if the remove was successful.</p>

</div>
<p>When a client calls <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, or <code>remove</code> on a collection, the collection's <code>allow</code> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#deny"><code>deny</code></a> callbacks are called on the server to determine if the write should be allowed. If at least one <code>allow</code> callback allows the write, and no <code>deny</code> callbacks deny the write, then the write is allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>These checks are run only when a client tries to write to the database directly, for example by calling <code>update</code> from inside an event handler. Server code is trusted and isn't subject to <code>allow</code> and <code>deny</code> restrictions. That includes methods that are called with <code>Meteor.call</code> &mdash; they are expected to do their own access checking rather than relying on <code>allow</code> and <code>deny</code>.</p>
<p>You can call <code>allow</code> as many times as you like, and each call can include any combination of <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>remove</code> functions. The functions should return <code>true</code> if they think the operation should be allowed. Otherwise they should return <code>false</code>, or nothing at all (<code>undefined</code>). In that case Meteor will continue searching through any other <code>allow</code> rules on the collection.</p>
<p>The available callbacks are:</p>
<dl class="callbacks">
<dt><span class="name">insert(userId, doc)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user <code>userId</code> wants to insert the document <code>doc</code> into the collection. Return <code>true</code> if this should be allowed.</p>
<p><code>doc</code> will contain the <code>_id</code> field if one was explicitly set by the client, or if there is an active <code>transform</code>. You can use this to prevent users from specifying arbitrary <code>_id</code> fields.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">update(userId, doc, fieldNames, modifier)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user <code>userId</code> wants to update a document <code>doc</code>. (<code>doc</code> is the current version of the document from the database, without the proposed update.) Return <code>true</code> to permit the change.</p>
<p><code>fieldNames</code> is an array of the (top-level) fields in <code>doc</code> that the client wants to modify, for example <code>['name',</code>&nbsp;<code>'score']</code>.</p>
<p><code>modifier</code> is the raw Mongo modifier that the client wants to execute; for example, <code>{$set: {'name.first': "Alice"}, $inc: {score: 1}}</code>.</p>
<p>Only Mongo modifiers are supported (operations like <code>$set</code> and <code>$push</code>). If the user tries to replace the entire document rather than use $-modifiers, the request will be denied without checking the <code>allow</code> functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">remove(userId, doc)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The user <code>userId</code> wants to remove <code>doc</code> from the database. Return <code>true</code> to permit this.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When calling <code>update</code> or <code>remove</code> Meteor will by default fetch the entire document <code>doc</code> from the database. If you have large documents you may wish to fetch only the fields that are actually used by your functions. Accomplish this by setting <code>fetch</code> to an array of field names to retrieve.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Create a collection where users can only modify documents that</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// they own. Ownership is tracked by an 'owner' field on each</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// document. All documents must be owned by the user that created</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// them and ownership can't be changed. Only a document's owner</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// is allowed to delete it, and the 'locked' attribute can be</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// set on a document to prevent its accidental deletion.</span>

</code></pre>
<p>If you never set up any <code>allow</code> rules on a collection then all client writes to the collection will be denied, and it will only be possible to write to the collection from server-side code. In this case you will have to create a method for each possible write that clients are allowed to do. You'll then call these methods with <code>Meteor.call</code> rather than having the clients call <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>remove</code> directly on the collection.</p>
<p>Meteor also has a special "insecure mode" for quickly prototyping new applications. In insecure mode, if you haven't set up any <code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code> rules on a collection, then all users have full write access to the collection. This is the only effect of insecure mode. If you call <code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code> at all on a collection, even <code>Posts.allow({})</code>, then access is checked just like normal on that collection. <strong>New Meteor projects start in insecure mode by default.</strong> To turn it off just run <code>$ meteor remove insecure</code>.</p>

<h3 id="modifiers" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/modifiers">Mongo-Style Modifiers</a></h3>
<p>A modifier is an object that describes how to update a document in place by changing some of its fields. Some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Set the 'admin' property on the document to true</span>
{$set: {admin: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>}}

<span class="hljs-comment">// Add 2 to the 'votes' property, and add "Traz"</span>

{$inc: {votes: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>}, $push: {supporters: <span class="hljs-string">"Traz"</span>}}
</code></pre>
<p>But if a modifier doesn't contain any $-operators, then it is instead interpreted as a literal document, and completely replaces whatever was previously in the database. (Literal document modifiers are not currently supported by <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow">validated updates</a>.)</p>
<pre><code class="hljs coffeescript"><span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> Find the <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span> <span class="hljs-reserved">with</span> id <span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> completely replace it.

<p>The last form will only work if your JavaScript implementation preserves the order of keys in objects. Most do, most of the time, but it's up to you to be sure.</p>
<h3 id="fieldspecifiers" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/fieldspecifiers">Field Specifiers</a></h3>
<p>Queries can specify a particular set of fields to include or exclude from the result object.</p>
<p>To exclude specific fields from the result objects, the field specifier is a dictionary whose keys are field names and whose values are <code>0</code>. All unspecified fields are included.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js">Users.find({}, {fields: {password: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, hash: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>}})
</code></pre>
<p>To include only specific fields in the result documents, use <code>1</code> as the value. The <code>_id</code> field is still included in the result.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js">Users.find({}, {fields: {firstname: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, lastname: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>}})
</code></pre>
<p>With one exception, it is not possible to mix inclusion and exclusion styles: the keys must either be all 1 or all 0. The exception is that you may specify <code>_id: 0</code> in an inclusion specifier, which will leave <code>_id</code> out of the result object as well. However, such field specifiers can not be used with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#observe_changes"><code>observeChanges</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#observe"><code>observe</code></a>, cursors returned from a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_publish">publish function</a>, or cursors used in <code>{{#each}}</code> in a template. They may be used with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#fetch"><code>fetch</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#findone"><code>findOne</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#foreach"><code>forEach</code></a>, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#map"><code>map</code></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/projection/">Field operators</a> such as <code>$</code> and <code>$elemMatch</code> are not available on the client side yet.</p>

<h2 id="session">Session</h2>
<p><code>Session</code> provides a global object on the client that you can use to store an arbitrary set of key-value pairs. Use it to store things like the currently selected item in a list.</p>
<p>What's special about <code>Session</code> is that it's reactive. If you call <a href="http://localhost:3000/#session_get"><code>Session.get</code></a><code>("currentList")</code> from inside a template, the template will automatically be rerendered whenever <a href="http://localhost:3000/#session_set"><code>Session.set</code></a><code>("currentList", x)</code> is called.</p>

<p>Using Session.equals here means that when the user clicks on an item and changes the selection, only the newly selected and the newly unselected items are re-rendered.</p>
<p>If Session.get had been used instead of Session.equals, then when the selection changed, all the items would be re-rendered.</p>
<p>For object and array session values, you cannot use <code>Session.equals</code>; instead, you need to use the <code>underscore</code> package and write <code>_.isEqual(Session.get(key), value)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="accounts_api">Accounts</h2>
<p>The Meteor Accounts system builds on top of the <code>userId</code> support in <a href="http://localhost:3000/#publish_userId"><code>publish</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#method_userId"><code>methods</code></a>. The core packages add the concept of user documents stored in the database, and additional packages add <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_passwords">secure password authentication</a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_loginwithexternalservice">integration with third party login services</a>, and a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accountsui">pre-built user interface</a>.</p>
<p>The basic Accounts system is in the <code>accounts-base</code> package, but applications typically include this automatically by adding one of the login provider packages: <code>accounts-password</code>, <code>accounts-facebook</code>, <code>accounts-github</code>, <code>accounts-google</code>, <code>accounts-meetup</code>, <code>accounts-twitter</code>, or <code>accounts-weibo</code>.</p>

<p>A user document can contain any data you want to store about a user. Meteor treats the following fields specially:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>username</code>: a unique String identifying the user.</li>
<li><code>emails</code>: an Array of Objects with keys <code>address</code> and <code>verified</code>; an email address may belong to at most one user. <code>verified</code> is a Boolean which is true if the user has <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_verifyemail">verified the address</a> with a token sent over email.</li>
<li><code>createdAt</code>: the Date at which the user document was created.</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: an Object which the user can create and update with any data. Do not store anything on <code>profile</code> that you wouldn't want the user to edit unless you have a deny rule on the <code>Meteor.users</code> collection.</li>
<li><code>services</code>: an Object containing data used by particular login services. For example, its <code>reset</code> field contains tokens used by <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_forgotpassword">forgot password</a> links, and its <code>resume</code> field contains tokens used to keep you logged in between sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like all <a href="http://localhost:3000/#collections">Mongo.Collection</a>s, you can access all documents on the server, but only those specifically published by the server are available on the client.</p>
<p>By default, the current user's <code>username</code>, <code>emails</code> and <code>profile</code> are published to the client. You can publish additional fields for the current user with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// server</span>
Meteor.publish(<span class="hljs-string">"userData"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.ready();
  }
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// client</span>
Meteor.subscribe(<span class="hljs-string">"userData"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>If the autopublish package is installed, information about all users on the system is published to all clients. This includes <code>username</code>, <code>profile</code>, and any fields in <code>services</code> that are meant to be public (eg <code>services.facebook.id</code>, <code>services.twitter.screenName</code>). Additionally, when using autopublish more information is published for the currently logged in user, including access tokens. This allows making API calls directly from the client for services that allow this.</p>
<p>Users are by default allowed to specify their own <code>profile</code> field with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_createuser"><code>Accounts.createUser</code></a> and modify it with <code>Meteor.users.update</code>. To allow users to edit additional fields, use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#allow"><code>Meteor.users.allow</code></a>. To forbid users from making any modifications to their user document:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Meteor.users.deny({update: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>; }});

<dd>
<p>Login style ("popup" or "redirect", defaults to the login service configuration). The "popup" style opens the login page in a separate popup window, which is generally preferred because the Meteor application doesn't need to be reloaded. The "redirect" style redirects the Meteor application's window to the login page, and the login service provider redirects back to the Meteor application which is then reloaded. The "redirect" style can be used in situations where a popup window can't be opened, such as in a mobile UIWebView. The "redirect" style however relies on session storage which isn't available in Safari private mode, so the "popup" style will be forced if session storage can't be used.</p>
</dd>

</div>
<p>Available functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithMeteorDeveloperAccount</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithFacebook</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithGithub</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithGoogle</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithMeetup</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithTwitter</code></li>
<li><code>Meteor.loginWithWeibo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These functions initiate the login process with an external service (eg: Facebook, Google, etc), using OAuth. When called they open a new pop-up window that loads the provider's login page. Once the user has logged in with the provider, the pop-up window is closed and the Meteor client logs in to the Meteor server with the information provided by the external service.</p>
<p><a id="requestpermissions" name="requestpermissions"></a></p>
<p>In addition to identifying the user to your application, some services have APIs that allow you to take action on behalf of the user. To request specific permissions from the user, pass the <code>requestPermissions</code> option the login function. This will cause the user to be presented with an additional page in the pop-up dialog to permit access to their data. The user's <code>accessToken</code> &mdash; with permissions to access the service's API &mdash; is stored in the <code>services</code> field of the user document. The supported values for <code>requestPermissions</code> differ for each login service and are documented on their respective developer sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/</a></li>
<li>GitHub: <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes</a></li>
<li>Google: <a href="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#scopeparameter">https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#scopeparameter</a></li>
<li>Meetup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/auth/#oauth2-scopes">http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/auth/#oauth2-scopes</a></li>
<li>Twitter, Weibo, Meteor developer accounts: <code>requestPermissions</code> currently not supported</li>
</ul>
<p>External login services typically require registering and configuring your application before use. The easiest way to do this is with the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accountsui"><code>accounts-ui</code> package</a> which presents a step-by-step guide to configuring each service. However, the data can be also be entered manually in the <code>ServiceConfiguration.configurations</code> collection, which is exported by the <code>service-configuration</code> package.</p>
<p>First, add the service configuration package:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash">meteor add service-configuration
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in your app:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js">ServiceConfiguration.configurations.upsert(
  { service: <span class="hljs-string">"weibo"</span> },
  {
    $set: {
      clientId: <span class="hljs-string">"1292962797"</span>,
      loginStyle: <span class="hljs-string">"popup"</span>,
      secret: <span class="hljs-string">"75a730b58f5691de5522789070c319bc"</span>
    }
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>Each external service has its own login provider package and login function. For example, to support GitHub login, run <code>$ meteor add accounts-github</code> and use the <code>Meteor.loginWithGithub</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Meteor.loginWithGithub({
  requestPermissions: [<span class="hljs-string">'user'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'public_repo'</span>]
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(err)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (err)
    Session.set(<span class="hljs-string">'errorMessage'</span>, err.reason || <span class="hljs-string">'Unknown error'</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Login service configuration is sent from the server to the client over DDP when your app starts up; you may not call the login function until the configuration is loaded. The function <code>Accounts.loginServicesConfigured()</code> is a reactive data source that will return true once the login service is configured; you should not make login buttons visible or active until it is true.</p>

</dl>
</div>
<p>Use this when you need to do more than simply accept or reject new user creation. With this function you can programatically control the contents of new user documents.</p>
<p>The function you pass will be called with two arguments: <code>options</code> and <code>user</code>. The <code>options</code> argument comes from <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_createuser"><code>Accounts.createUser</code></a> for password-based users or from an external service login flow. <code>options</code> may come from an untrusted client so make sure to validate any values you read from it. The <code>user</code> argument is created on the server and contains a proposed user object with all the automatically generated fields required for the user to log in.</p>
<p>The function should return the user document (either the one passed in or a newly-created object) with whatever modifications are desired. The returned document is inserted directly into the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_users"><code>Meteor.users</code></a> collection.</p>
<p>The default create user function simply copies <code>options.profile</code> into the new user document. Calling <code>onCreateUser</code> overrides the default hook. This can only be called once.</p>

<p>A validate login callback must return a truthy value for the login to proceed. If the callback returns a falsy value or throws an exception, the login is aborted. Throwing a <code>Meteor.Error</code> will report the error reason to the user.</p>
<p>All registered validate login callbacks are called, even if one of the callbacks aborts the login. The later callbacks will see the <code>allowed</code> field set to <code>false</code> since the login will now not be successful. This allows later callbacks to override an error from a previous callback; for example, you could override the "Incorrect password" error with a different message.</p>
<p>Validate login callbacks that aren't explicitly trying to override a previous error generally have no need to run if the attempt has already been determined to fail, and should start with</p>

<p>Either the <code>onLogin</code> or the <code>onLoginFailure</code> callbacks will be called for each login attempt. The <code>onLogin</code> callbacks are called after the user has been successfully logged in. The <code>onLoginFailure</code> callbacks are called after a login attempt is denied.</p>
<p>These functions return an object with a single method, <code>stop</code>. Calling <code>stop()</code> unregisters the callback.</p>
<p>On the server, the callbacks get a single argument, the same attempt info object as <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_validateloginattempt"><code>validateLoginAttempt</code></a>. On the client, no arguments are passed.</p>
<h2 id="accounts_passwords">Passwords</h2>
<p>The <code>accounts-password</code> package contains a full system for password-based authentication. In addition to the basic username and password-based sign-in process, it also supports email-based sign-in including address verification and password recovery emails.</p>
<p>The Meteor server stores passwords using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> algorithm. This helps protect against embarrassing password leaks if the server's database is compromised.</p>
<p>To add password support to your application, run <code>$ meteor add accounts-password</code>. You can construct your own user interface using the functions below, or use the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accountsui"><code>accounts-ui</code> package</a> to include a turn-key user interface for password-based sign-in.</p>

<p>On the client, this function logs in as the newly created user on successful completion. On the server, it returns the newly created user id.</p>
<p>On the client, you must pass <code>password</code> and at least one of <code>username</code> or <code>email</code> &mdash; enough information for the user to be able to log in again later. On the server, you do not need to specify <code>password</code>, but the user will not be able to log in until it has a password (eg, set with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_setpassword"><code>Accounts.setPassword</code></a>).</p>
<p>To create an account without a password on the server and still let the user pick their own password, call <code>createUser</code> with the <code>email</code> option and then call <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_sendenrollmentemail"><code>Accounts.sendEnrollmentEmail</code></a>. This will send the user an email with a link to set their initial password.</p>

<h2 id="templates_api">Templates</h2>
<p>When you write a template as <code>&lt;template name="foo"&gt; ... &lt;/template&gt;</code> in an HTML file in your app, Meteor generates a "template object" named <code>Template.foo</code>.</p>
<p>The same template may occur many times on a page, and these occurrences are called template instances. Template instances have a life cycle of being created, put into the document, and later taken out of the document and destroyed. Meteor manages these stages for you, including determining when a template instance has been removed or replaced and should be cleaned up. You can associate data with a template instance, and you can access its DOM nodes when it is in the document.</p>

  <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> function () {
    return Session.<span class="hljs-function">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>)</span></span>;
  <span class="hljs-rule">}</span></span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can invoke this helper with <code>{{foo}}</code> in the template defined with <code>&lt;template name="myTemplate"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Helpers can accept positional and keyword arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Template.myTemplate.helpers({
  displayName: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(firstName, lastName, keyword)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> prefix = keyword.hash.title ? keyword.hash.title + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span> : <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> prefix + firstName + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span> + lastName;
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can call this helper from template like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">{{displayName <span class="hljs-string">"John"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Doe"</span> title=<span class="hljs-string">"President"</span>}}
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn more about arguments to helpers in <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/spacebars">Spacebars Readme</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, each helper starts a new <a href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a>. When its reactive dependencies change, the helper is rerun. Helpers depend on their data context, passed arguments and other reactive data sources accessed during execution.</p>
<p>To create a helper that can be used in any template, use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_registerhelper"><code>Template.registerHelper</code></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Callbacks added with this method are called once when an instance of Template.<em>myTemplate</em> is rendered into DOM nodes and put into the document for the first time.</p>
<p>In the body of a callback, <code>this</code> is a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_inst">template instance</a> object that is unique to this occurrence of the template and persists across re-renderings. Use the <code>onCreated</code> and <code>onDestroyed</code> callbacks to perform initialization or clean-up on the object.</p>
<p>Because your template has been rendered, you can use functions like <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_findAll"><code>this.findAll</code></a> which look at its DOM nodes.</p>

<p>Callbacks added with this method called before your template's logic is evaluated for the first time. Inside a callback, <code>this</code> is the new <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_inst">template instance</a> object. Properties you set on this object will be visible from the callbacks added with <code>onRendered</code> and <code>onDestroyed</code> methods and from event handlers.</p>
<p>These callbacks fire once and are the first group of callbacks to fire. Handling the <code>created</code> event is a useful way to set up values on template instance that are read from template helpers using <code>Template.instance()</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>These callbacks are called when an occurrence of a template is taken off the page for any reason and not replaced with a re-rendering. Inside a callback, <code>this</code> is the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_inst">template instance</a> object being destroyed.</p>
<p>This group of callbacks is most useful for cleaning up or undoing any external effects of <code>created</code> or <code>rendered</code> groups. This group fires once and is the last callback to fire.</p>
<h2 id="template_inst">Template instances</h2>
<p>A template instance object represents an occurrence of a template in the document. It can be used to access the DOM and it can be assigned properties that persist as the template is reactively updated.</p>
<p>Template instance objects are found as the value of <code>this</code> in the <code>onCreated</code>, <code>onRendered</code>, and <code>onDestroyed</code> template callbacks, and as an argument to event handlers. You can access the current template instance from helpers using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_instance"><code>Template.instance()</code></a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the properties and functions described below, you can assign additional properties of your choice to the object. Use the <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_onCreated"><code>onCreated</code></a> and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_onDestroyed"><code>onDestroyed</code></a> methods to add callbacks performing initialization or clean-up on the object.</p>
<p>You can only access <code>findAll</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>firstNode</code>, and <code>lastNode</code> from the <code>onRendered</code> callback and event handlers, not from <code>onCreated</code> and <code>onDestroyed</code>, because they require the template instance to be in the DOM.</p>
<p>Template instance objects are <code>instanceof Blaze.TemplateInstance</code>.</p>

<h3 id="eventmaps" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/eventmaps">Event Maps</a></h3>
<p>An event map is an object where the properties specify a set of events to handle, and the values are the handlers for those events. The property can be in one of several forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="name"><em>eventtype</em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a particular type of event, such as 'click'.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name"><em>eventtype selector</em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a particular type of event, but only when it appears on an element that matches a certain CSS selector.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name"><em>event1, event2</em></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>To handle more than one type of event with the same function, use a comma-separated list.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The handler function receives two arguments: <code>event</code>, an object with information about the event, and <code>template</code>, a <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_inst">template instance</a> for the template where the handler is defined. The handler also receives some additional context data in <code>this</code>, depending on the context of the current element handling the event. In a template, an element's context is the data context where that element occurs, which is set by block helpers such as <code>#with</code> and <code>#each</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs coffeescript">{
  <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> Fires <span class="hljs-keyword">when</span> any element <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> clicked
  <span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>: <span class="hljs-reserved">function</span> (event) { ... },

  <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> Fires <span class="hljs-keyword">when</span> any element <span class="hljs-reserved">with</span> the <span class="hljs-string">'accept'</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">is</span> <span class="hljs-title">clicked</span></span>
  <span class="hljs-string">'click .accept'</span>: <span class="hljs-reserved">function</span> (event) { ... },

  <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> Fires <span class="hljs-keyword">when</span> <span class="hljs-string">'accept'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> clicked <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> focused, <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> a key <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> pressed
  <span class="hljs-string">'click .accept, focus .accept, keypress'</span>: <span class="hljs-reserved">function</span> (event) { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Most events bubble up the document tree from their originating element. For example, <code>'click p'</code> catches a click anywhere in a paragraph, even if the click originated on a link, span, or some other element inside the paragraph. The originating element of the event is available as the <code>target</code> property, while the element that matched the selector and is currently handling it is called <code>currentTarget</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">{
  <span class="hljs-string">'click p'</span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(event)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> paragraph = event.currentTarget; <span class="hljs-comment">// always a P</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> clickedElement = event.target; <span class="hljs-comment">// could be the P or a child element</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If a selector matches multiple elements that an event bubbles to, it will be called multiple times, for example in the case of <code>'click div'</code> or <code>'click *'</code>. If no selector is given, the handler will only be called once, on the original target element.</p>
<p>The following properties and methods are available on the event object passed to handlers:</p>
<dl class="objdesc">
<dt><span class="name">type</span> <span class="type">String</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The event's type, such as "click", "blur" or "keypress".</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">target</span> <span class="type">DOM Element</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The element that originated the event.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">currentTarget</span> <span class="type">DOM Element</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The element currently handling the event. This is the element that matched the selector in the event map. For events that bubble, it may be <code>target</code> or an ancestor of <code>target</code>, and its value changes as the event bubbles.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">which</span> <span class="type">Number</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>For mouse events, the number of the mouse button (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right). For key events, a character or key code.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">stopPropagation()</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Prevent the event from propagating (bubbling) up to other elements. Other event handlers matching the same element are still fired, in this and other event maps.</p>

<h2 id="blaze">Blaze</h2>
<p>Blaze is the package that makes reactive templates possible. You can use the Blaze API directly in order to render templates programmatically and manipulate "Views," the building blocks of reactive templates.

</div>
<p>Behind every template or part of a template &mdash; a template tag, say, like <code>{{foo}}</code> or <code>{{#if}}</code> &mdash; is a View object, which is a reactively updating region of DOM.</p>
<p>Most applications do not need to be aware of these Views, but they offer a way to understand and customize Meteor's rendering behavior for more advanced applications and packages.</p>
<p>You can obtain a View object by calling <a href="http://localhost:3000/#blaze_render"><code>Blaze.render</code></a> on a template, or by accessing <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_view"><code>template.view</code></a> on a template instance.</p>
<p>At the heart of a View is an <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun">autorun</a> that calls the View's <code>renderFunction</code>, uses the result to create DOM nodes, and replaces the contents of the View with these new DOM nodes. A View's content may consist of any number of consecutive DOM nodes (though if it is zero, a placeholder node such as a comment or an empty text node is automatically supplied). Any reactive dependency established by <code>renderFunction</code> causes a full recalculation of the View's contents when the dependency is invalidated. Templates, however, are compiled in such a way that they do not have top-level dependencies and so will only ever render once, while their parts may re-render many times.</p>
<p>When a <code>Blaze.View</code> is constructed by calling the constructor, no hooks are fired and no rendering is performed. In particular, the View is not yet considered to be "created." Only when the View is actually used, by a call to <code>Blaze.render</code> or <code>Blaze.toHTML</code> or by inclusion in another View, is it "created," right before it is rendered for the first time. When a View is created, its <code>.parentView</code> is set if appropriate, and then the <code>onViewCreated</code> hook is fired. The term "unrendered View" means a newly constructed View that has not been "created" or rendered.</p>
<p>The "current View" is kept in <a href="http://localhost:3000/#blaze_currentview"><code>Blaze.currentView</code></a> and is set during View rendering, callbacks, autoruns, and template event handlers. It affects calls such as <a href="http://localhost:3000/#template_currentdata"><code>Template.currentData()</code></a>.</p>
<p>The following properties and methods are available on Blaze.View:</p>
<dl class="objdesc">
<dt><span id="view_name" class="name">name</span> <span class="type">String</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of this type of View. View names may be used to identify particular kinds of Views in code, but more often they simply aid in debugging and comprehensibility of the View tree. Views generated by Meteor have names like "Template.foo" and "if".</p>

</dd>
<dt><span id="view_isrendered" class="name">isRendered</span> <span class="type">Boolean</span></dt>

<h2 id="tracker">Tracker</h2>
<p>Meteor has a simple dependency tracking system which allows it to automatically rerun templates and other computations whenever <a href="http://localhost:3000/#session"><code>Session</code></a> variables, database queries, and other data sources change.</p>
<p>Unlike most other systems, you don't have to manually declare these dependencies &mdash; it "just works". The mechanism is simple and efficient. When you call a function that supports reactive updates (such as a database query), it automatically saves the current Computation object, if any (representing, for example, the current template being rendered). Later, when the data changes, the function can "invalidate" the Computation, causing it to rerun (rerendering the template).</p>
<p>Applications will find <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a> useful, while more advanced facilities such as <code>Tracker.Dependency</code> and <code>onInvalidate</code> callbacks are intended primarily for package authors implementing new reactive data sources.</p>
<p>To learn more about how Tracker works and to explore advanced ways to use it, visit the <a href="http://manual.meteor.com/#tracker"> Tracker</a> chapter in the <a href="http://manual.meteor.com/">Meteor Manual</a>, which describes it in complete detail.</p>
<div class="api new-api-box">
<h3 id="tracker_autorun" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/tracker_autorun">Tracker.autorun(runFunc)</a> <span class="locus">Client</span></h3>
<div class="desc">
<p>Run a function now and rerun it later whenever its dependencies change. Returns a Computation object that can be used to stop or observe the rerunning.</p>
</div>
<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl class="args">
<dt><span class="name">runFunc</span> <span class="type">Function</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The function to run. It receives one argument: the Computation object that will be returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p><code>Tracker.autorun</code> allows you to run a function that depends on reactive data sources, in such a way that if there are changes to the data later, the function will be rerun.</p>
<p>For example, you can monitor a cursor (which is a reactive data source) and aggregate it into a session variable:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Tracker.autorun(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> oldest = _.max(Monkeys.find().fetch(), <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(monkey)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> monkey.age;
  });
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (oldest)
    Session.set(<span class="hljs-string">"oldest"</span>, oldest.name);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can wait for a session variable to have a certain value, and do something the first time it does, calling <code>stop</code> on the computation to prevent further rerunning:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">Tracker.autorun(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(c)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (! Session.equals(<span class="hljs-string">"shouldAlert"</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>))
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;

  c.stop();
  alert(<span class="hljs-string">"Oh no!"</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>The function is invoked immediately, at which point it may alert and stop right away if <code>shouldAlert</code> is already true. If not, the function is run again when <code>shouldAlert</code> becomes true.</p>
<p>A change to a data dependency does not cause an immediate rerun, but rather "invalidates" the computation, causing it to rerun the next time a flush occurs. A flush will occur automatically as soon as the system is idle if there are invalidated computations. You can also use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_flush"><code>Tracker.flush</code></a> to cause an immediate flush of all pending reruns.</p>
<p>If you nest calls to <code>Tracker.autorun</code>, then when the outer call stops or reruns, the inner call will stop automatically. Subscriptions and observers are also automatically stopped when used as part of a computation that is rerun, allowing new ones to be established. See <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_subscribe"><code>Meteor.subscribe</code></a> for more information about subscriptions and reactivity.</p>
<p>If the initial run of an autorun throws an exception, the computation is automatically stopped and won't be rerun.</p>
<div class="api new-api-box">
<h3 id="tracker_flush" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/tracker_flush">Tracker.flush()</a> <span class="locus">Client</span></h3>
<div class="desc">
<p>Process all reactive updates immediately and ensure that all invalidated computations are rerun.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Normally, when you make changes (like writing to the database), their impact (like updating the DOM) is delayed until the system is idle. This keeps things predictable &mdash; you can know that the DOM won't go changing out from under your code as it runs. It's also one of the things that makes Meteor fast.</p>
<p><code>Tracker.flush</code> forces all of the pending reactive updates to complete. For example, if an event handler changes a Session variable that will cause part of the user interface to rerender, the handler can call <code>flush</code> to perform the rerender immediately and then access the resulting DOM.</p>
<p>An automatic flush occurs whenever the system is idle which performs exactly the same work as <code>Tracker.flush</code>. The flushing process consists of rerunning any invalidated computations. If additional invalidations happen while flushing, they are processed as part of the same flush until there is no more work to be done. Callbacks registered with <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_afterflush"><code>Tracker.afterFlush</code></a> are called after processing outstanding invalidations.</p>
<p>It is illegal to call <code>flush</code> from inside a <code>flush</code> or from a running computation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://manual.meteor.com/#tracker-theflushcycle">Meteor Manual</a> describes the motivation for the flush cycle and the guarantees made by <code>Tracker.flush</code> and <code>Tracker.afterFlush</code>.</p>

<p>Functions scheduled by multiple calls to <code>afterFlush</code> are guaranteed to run in the order that <code>afterFlush</code> was called. Functions are guaranteed to be called at a time when there are no invalidated computations that need rerunning. This means that if an <code>afterFlush</code> function invalidates a computation, that computation will be rerun before any other <code>afterFlush</code> functions are called.</p>
<h2 id="tracker_computation">Tracker.Computation</h2>
<p>A Computation object represents code that is repeatedly rerun in response to reactive data changes. Computations don't have return values; they just perform actions, such as rerendering a template on the screen. Computations are created using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_autorun"><code>Tracker.autorun</code></a>. Use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#computation_stop"><code>stop</code></a> to prevent further rerunning of a computation.</p>
<p>Each time a computation runs, it may access various reactive data sources that serve as inputs to the computation, which are called its dependencies. At some future time, one of these dependencies may trigger the computation to be rerun by invalidating it. When this happens, the dependencies are cleared, and the computation is scheduled to be rerun at flush time.</p>
<p>The <em>current computation</em> (<a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_currentcomputation"><code>Tracker.currentComputation</code></a>) is the computation that is currently being run or rerun (computed), and the one that gains a dependency when a reactive data source is accessed. Data sources are responsible for tracking these dependencies using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_dependency"><code>Tracker.Dependency</code></a> objects.</p>
<p>Invalidating a computation sets its <code>invalidated</code> property to true and immediately calls all of the computation's <code>onInvalidate</code> callbacks. When a flush occurs, if the computation has been invalidated and not stopped, then the computation is rerun by setting the <code>invalidated</code> property to <code>false</code> and calling the original function that was passed to <code>Tracker.autorun</code>. A flush will occur when the current code finishes running, or sooner if <code>Tracker.flush</code> is called.</p>
<p>Stopping a computation invalidates it (if it is valid) for the purpose of calling callbacks, but ensures that it will never be rerun.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// if we're in a computation, then perform some clean-up</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// when the current computation is invalidated (rerun or</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// stopped)</span>

<p>Stopping a computation is irreversible and guarantees that it will never be rerun. You can stop a computation at any time, including from the computation's own run function. Stopping a computation that is already stopped has no effect.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Invalidating a computation marks it to be rerun at <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_flush">flush time</a>, at which point the computation becomes valid again. It is rare to invalidate a computation manually, because reactive data sources invalidate their calling computations when they change. Reactive data sources in turn perform this invalidation using one or more <a href="http://localhost:3000/#tracker_dependency"><code>Tracker.Dependency</code></a> objects.</p>
<p>Invalidating a computation immediately calls all <code>onInvalidate</code> callbacks registered on it. Invalidating a computation that is currently invalidated or is stopped has no effect. A computation can invalidate itself, but if it continues to do so indefinitely, the result will be an infinite loop.</p>

<p>This property is a convenience to support the common pattern where a computation has logic specific to the first run.</p>
<h2 id="tracker_dependency">Tracker.Dependency</h2>
<p>A Dependency represents an atomic unit of reactive data that a computation might depend on. Reactive data sources such as Session or Minimongo internally create different Dependency objects for different pieces of data, each of which may be depended on by multiple computations. When the data changes, the computations are invalidated.</p>
<p>Dependencies don't store data, they just track the set of computations to invalidate if something changes. Typically, a data value will be accompanied by a Dependency object that tracks the computations that depend on it, as in this example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> weather = <span class="hljs-string">"sunny"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> weatherDep = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Tracker.Dependency;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> getWeather = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
  weatherDep.depend()
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> weather;
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> setWeather = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-params">(w)</span> </span>{
  weather = w;
  <span class="hljs-comment">// (could add logic here to only call changed()</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// if the new value is different from the old)</span>
  weatherDep.changed();
};
</code></pre>
<p>This example implements a weather data source with a simple getter and setter. The getter records that the current computation depends on the <code>weatherDep</code> dependency using <code>depend()</code>, while the setter signals the dependency to invalidate all dependent computations by calling <code>changed()</code>.</p>
<p>The reason Dependencies do not store data themselves is that it can be useful to associate multiple Dependencies with the same piece of data. For example, one Dependency might represent the result of a database query, while another might represent just the number of documents in the result. A Dependency could represent whether the weather is sunny or not, or whether the temperature is above freezing. <a href="http://localhost:3000/#session_equals"><code>Session.equals</code></a> is implemented this way for efficiency. When you call <code>Session.equals("weather", "sunny")</code>, the current computation is made to depend on an internal Dependency that does not change if the weather goes from, say, "rainy" to "cloudy".</p>
<p>Conceptually, the only two things a Dependency can do are gain a dependent and change.</p>
<p>A Dependency's dependent computations are always valid (they have <code>invalidated === false</code>). If a dependent is invalidated at any time, either by the Dependency itself or some other way, it is immediately removed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://manual.meteor.com/#tracker-reactivevaluewithdependency"> Meteor Manual</a> to learn how to create a reactive data source using Tracker.Dependency.</p>

<h2 id="reactivevar_pkg">ReactiveVar</h2>
<p>To use <code>ReactiveVar</code>, add the <code>reactive-var</code> package to your project with <code>$ meteor add reactive-var</code>.</p>
<div class="api new-api-box">
<h3 id="reactivevar" class="api-title"><a class="name selflink" href="http://localhost:3000/#/full/reactivevar">new ReactiveVar(initialValue, [equalsFunc])</a> <span class="locus">Client</span></h3>
<div class="desc">
<p>Constructor for a ReactiveVar, which represents a single reactive variable.</p>
</div>
<h4>Arguments</h4>
<dl class="args">
<dt><span class="name">initialValue</span> <span class="type">Any</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The initial value to set. <code>equalsFunc</code> is ignored when setting the initial value.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">equalsFunc</span> <span class="type">Function</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional. A function of two arguments, called on the old value and the new value whenever the ReactiveVar is set. If it returns true, no set is performed. If omitted, the default <code>equalsFunc</code> returns true if its arguments are <code>===</code> and are of type number, boolean, string, undefined, or null.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>A ReactiveVar holds a single value that can be get and set, such that calling <code>set</code> will invalidate any Computations that called <code>get</code>, according to the usual contract for reactive data sources.</p>
<p>A ReactiveVar is similar to a Session variable, with a few differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ReactiveVars don't have global names, like the "foo" in <code>Session.get("foo")</code>. Instead, they may be created and used locally, for example attached to a template instance, as in: <code>this.foo.get()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ReactiveVars are not automatically migrated across hot code pushes, whereas Session state is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ReactiveVars can hold any value, while Session variables are limited to JSON or EJSON.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An important property of ReactiveVars &mdash; which is sometimes a reason for using one &mdash; is that setting the value to the same value as before has no effect; it does not trigger any invalidations. So if one autorun sets a ReactiveVar, and another autorun gets the ReactiveVar, a re-run of the first autorun won't necessarily trigger the second. By default, only primitive values are compared this way, while calling <code>set</code> on an argument that is an <em>object</em> (not a primitive) always counts as a change. You can configure this behavior using the <code>equalsFunc</code> argument.</p>

<h2 id="ejson">EJSON</h2>
<p>EJSON is an extension of JSON to support more types. It supports all JSON-safe types, as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date</strong> (JavaScript <code>Date</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Binary</strong> (JavaScript <code>Uint8Array</code> or the result of <a href="http://localhost:3000/#ejson_new_binary"><code>EJSON.newBinary</code></a>)</li>
<li><strong>User-defined types</strong> (see <a href="http://localhost:3000/#ejson_add_type"><code>EJSON.addType</code></a>. For example, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#mongo_object_id"><code>Mongo.ObjectID</code></a> is implemented this way.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All EJSON serializations are also valid JSON. For example an object with a date and a binary buffer would be serialized in EJSON as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs json">{
  "<span class="hljs-attribute">d</span>": <span class="hljs-value">{"<span class="hljs-attribute">$date</span>": <span class="hljs-number">1358205756553</span>}</span>,

</div>
<p>This function initiates an HTTP request to a remote server.</p>
<p>On the server, this function can be run either synchronously or asynchronously. If the callback is omitted, it runs synchronously and the results are returned once the request completes successfully. If the request was not successful, an error is thrown. This is useful when making server-to-server HTTP API calls from within Meteor methods, as the method can succeed or fail based on the results of the synchronous HTTP call. In this case, consider using <a href="http://localhost:3000/#method_unblock"><code>this.unblock()</code></a> to allow other methods on the same connection to run in the mean time. On the client, this function must be used asynchronously by passing a callback.</p>
<p>Both HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. The <code>url</code> argument must be an absolute URL including protocol and host name on the server, but may be relative to the current host on the client. The <code>query</code> option replaces the query string of <code>url</code>. Parameters specified in <code>params</code> that are put in the URL are appended to any query string. For example, with a <code>url</code> of <code>"/path?query"</code> and <code>params</code> of <code>{foo:"bar"}</code>, the final URL will be <code>"/path?query&amp;foo=bar"</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>params</code> are put in the URL or the request body, depending on the type of request. In the case of request with no bodies, like GET and HEAD, the parameters will always go in the URL. For a POST or other type of request, the parameters will be encoded into the body with a standard <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content type, unless the <code>content</code> or <code>data</code> option is used to specify a body, in which case the parameters will be appended to the URL instead.</p>
<p>When run in asynchronous mode, the callback receives two arguments, <code>error</code> and <code>result</code>. The <code>error</code> argument will contain an Error if the request fails in any way, including a network error, time-out, or an HTTP status code in the 400 or 500 range. In case of a 4xx/5xx HTTP status code, the <code>response</code> property on <code>error</code> matches the contents of the result object. When run in synchronous mode, either <code>result</code> is returned from the function, or <code>error</code> is thrown.</p>
<p>Contents of the result object:</p>
<dl class="objdesc">

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>The <code>email</code> package allows sending email from a Meteor app. To use it, add the package to your project with <code>$ meteor add email</code>.</p>
<p>The server reads from the <code>MAIL_URL</code> environment variable to determine how to send mail. Currently, Meteor supports sending mail over SMTP; the <code>MAIL_URL</code> environment variable should be of the form <code>smtp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/</code>. For apps deployed with <code>meteor deploy</code>, <code>MAIL_URL</code> defaults to an account (provided by <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a>) which allows apps to send up to 200 emails per day; you may override this default by assigning to <code>process.env.MAIL_URL</code> before your first call to <code>Email.send</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>MAIL_URL</code> is not set (eg, when running your application locally), <code>Email.send</code> outputs the message to standard output instead.</p>

<h3 id="packagetests">Unit Tests</h3>
<p>Set up your tests with the <code>Package.onTest</code> handler, which has an interface that's parallel to that of the <code>onUse</code> handler. The tests will need to depend on the package that you have just created. For example, if your package is the <code>email</code> package, you have to call <code>api.use('email')</code> in order to test the package.</p>
<p>If you used <code>meteor create</code> to set up your package, Meteor will create the required scaffolding in <code>package.js</code>, and you'll only need to add unit test code in the <code>_test.js</code> file that was created.</p>

<h1 id="packages">Packages</h1>
<p>Meteor supports a variety of add-on packages and third party libraries. While you can build great applications using only the Meteor core functionality, optional packages can make development even faster and better.</p>
<p>Packages can be added to a Meteor project with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-prompt">$ meteor add &lt;package_name&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>and removed with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-prompt">$ meteor remove &lt;package_name&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Some of the packages that Meteor Development Group maintains include:</p>
<h2 id="appcache"><code>appcache</code></h2>
<p>The <code>appcache</code> package stores the static parts of a Meteor application (the client side Javascript, HTML, CSS, and images) in the browser's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppCache">application cache</a>. To enable caching simply add the <code>appcache</code> package to your project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once a user has visited a Meteor application for the first time and the application has been cached, on subsequent visits the web page loads faster because the browser can load the application out of the cache without contacting the server first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hot code pushes are loaded by the browser in the background while the app continues to run. Once the new code has been fully loaded the browser is able to switch over to the new code quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application cache allows the application to be loaded even when the browser doesn't have an Internet connection, and so enables using the app offline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note however that the <code>appcache</code> package by itself doesn't make <em>data</em> available offline: in an application loaded offline, a Meteor Collection will appear to be empty in the client until the Internet becomes available and the browser is able to establish a DDP connection).</p>
<p>To turn AppCache off for specific browsers use:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-tag">Meteor</span><span class="hljs-class">.AppCache</span><span class="hljs-class">.config</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
  <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">chrome</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> false,
  firefox: false
</span></span></span>});
</code></pre>
<p>The supported browsers that can be enabled or disabled include, but are not limited to, <code>android</code>, <code>chrome</code>, <code>chromium</code>, <code>chromeMobileIOS</code>, <code>firefox</code>, <code>ie</code>, <code>mobileSafari</code> and <code>safari</code>.</p>
<p>Browsers limit the amount of data they will put in the application cache, which can vary due to factors such as how much disk space is free. Unfortunately if your application goes over the limit rather than disabling the application cache altogether and running the application online, the browser will instead fail that particular <em>update</em> of the cache, leaving your users running old code.</p>
<p>Thus it's best to keep the size of the cache below 5MB. The <code>appcache</code> package will print a warning on the Meteor server console if the total size of the resources being cached is over 5MB.</p>
<p>If you have files too large to fit in the cache you can disable caching by URL prefix. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-tag">Meteor</span><span class="hljs-class">.AppCache</span><span class="hljs-class">.config</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{<span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">onlineOnly</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> [<span class="hljs-string">'/online/'</span>]</span></span></span>});
</code></pre>
<p>causes files in your <code>public/online</code> directory to not be cached, and so they will only be available online. You can then move your large files into that directory and refer to them at the new URL:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">img</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"/online/bigimage.jpg"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you'd prefer not to move your files, you can use the file names themselves as the URL prefix:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-tag">Meteor</span><span class="hljs-class">.AppCache</span><span class="hljs-class">.config</span>(<span class="hljs-rules">{
  <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">onlineOnly</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> [
    <span class="hljs-string">'/bigimage.jpg'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">'/largedata.json'</span>
  ]
</span></span></span>});
</code></pre>
<p>though keep in mind that since the exclusion is by prefix (this is a limitation of the application cache manifest), excluding <code>/largedata.json</code> will also exclude such URLs as <code>/largedata.json.orig</code> and <code>/largedata.json/file1</code>.</p>
<p>For more information about how Meteor interacts with the application cache, see the <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/AppCache">AppCache page</a> in the Meteor wiki.</p>
<h2 id="accountsui"><code>accounts-ui</code></h2>
<p>A turn-key user interface for Meteor Accounts.</p>
<p>To add Accounts and a set of login controls to an application, add the <code>accounts-ui</code> package and at least one login provider package: <code>accounts-password</code>, <code>accounts-facebook</code>, <code>accounts-github</code>, <code>accounts-google</code>, <code>accounts-twitter</code>, or <code>accounts-weibo</code>.</p>
<p>Then simply add the <code>{{&gt; loginButtons}}</code> helper to an HTML file. This will place a login widget on the page. If there is only one provider configured and it is an external service, this will add a login/logout button. If you use <code>accounts-password</code> or use multiple external login services, this will add a "Sign in" link which opens a dropdown menu with login options. If you plan to position the login dropdown in the right edge of the screen, use <code>{{&gt; loginButtons align="right"}}</code> in order to get the dropdown to lay itself out without expanding off the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>To configure the behavior of <code>{{&gt; loginButtons}}</code>, use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_ui_config"><code>Accounts.ui.config</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>accounts-ui</code> also includes modal popup dialogs to handle links from <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_sendresetpasswordemail"><code>sendResetPasswordEmail</code></a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_sendverificationemail"><code>sendVerificationEmail</code></a>, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/#accounts_sendenrollmentemail"><code>sendEnrollmentEmail</code></a>. These do not have to be manually placed in HTML: they are automatically activated when the URLs are loaded.</p>
<h2 id="auditargumentchecks"><code>audit-argument-checks</code></h2>
<p>This package causes Meteor to require that all arguments passed to methods and publish functions are <a href="http://localhost:3000/#check"><code>check</code>ed</a>. Any method that does not pass each one of its arguments to <code>check</code> will throw an error, which will be logged on the server and which will appear to the client as a <code>500 Internal server error</code>. This is a simple way to help ensure that your app has complete check coverage.</p>
<p>Methods and publish functions that do not need to validate their arguments can simply run <code>check(arguments, [Match.Any])</code> to satisfy the <code>audit-argument-checks</code> coverage checker.</p>
<h2 id="coffeescript"><code>coffeescript</code></h2>
<p><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It provides a simple syntax without lots of braces and parentheses. The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.</p>
<p>CoffeeScript is supported on both the client and the server. Files ending with <code>.coffee</code>, <code>.litcoffee</code>, or <code>.coffee.md</code> are automatically compiled to JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="namespacingandcoffeescript">Namespacing and CoffeeScript</h3>
<p>Here's how CoffeeScript works with Meteor's namespacing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per the usual CoffeeScript convention, CoffeeScript variables are file-scoped by default (visible only in the <code>.coffee</code> file where they are defined.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When writing a package, CoffeeScript-defined variables can be exported like any other variable (see <a href="http://localhost:3000/#writingpackages">Writing Packages</a>). Exporting a variable pulls it up to package scope, meaning that it will be visible to all of the code in your app or package (both <code>.js</code> and <code>.coffee</code> files).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Package-scope variables declared in <code>.js</code> files are visible in any <code>.coffee</code> files in the same app or project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no way to make a package-scope variable from a <code>.coffee</code> file other than exporting it. We couldn't figure out a way to make this fit naturally inside the CoffeeScript language. If you want to use package-scope variables with CoffeeScript, one way is to make a short <code>.js</code> file that declares all of your package-scope variables. They can then be used and assigned to from <code>.coffee</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to share variables between <code>.coffee</code> files in the same package, and don't want to separately declare them in a <code>.js</code> file, we have an experimental feature that you may like. An object called <code>share</code> is visible in CoffeeScript code and is shared across all <code>.coffee</code> files in the same package. So, you can write <code>share.foo</code> for a value that is shared between all CoffeeScript code in a package, but doesn't escape that package.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Heavy CoffeeScript users, please let us know how this arrangement works for you, whether <code>share</code> is helpful for you, and anything else you'd like to see changed.</p>
<h2 id="jquery"><code>jquery</code></h2>
<p><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.</p>
<p>The <code>jquery</code> package adds the jQuery library to the client JavaScript bundle. It has no effect on the server.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>jquery</code> package, Meteor provides several jQuery plugins as separate packages. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/balupton/history.js"><code>jquery-history</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://layout.jquery-dev.net/"><code>jquery-layout</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/"><code>jquery-waypoints</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="less"><code>less</code></h2>
<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. It allows for more compact stylesheets and helps reduce code duplication in CSS files.</p>
<p>With the <code>less</code> package installed, <code>.less</code> files in your application are automatically compiled to CSS and the results are included in the client CSS bundle.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>If you want to <code>@import</code> a file, give it the extension <code>.import.less</code> to prevent Meteor from processing it independently.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="markdown"><code>markdown</code></h2>
<p>This package lets you use Markdown in your templates. It's easy: just put your markdown inside <code>{{#markdown}} ... {{/markdown}}</code> tags. You can still use all of the usual Meteor template features inside a Markdown block, such as <code>{{#each}}</code>, and you still get reactivity.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><code>{{#markdown}}I am using __markdown__.{{/markdown}}</code></p>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>I am using <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">strong</span>&gt;</span>markdown<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">strong</span>&gt;</span>.<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="oauthencryption"><code>oauth-encryption</code></h2>
<p>Encrypts sensitive account credential information stored in the database. See packages/oauth-encryption/README.md for details.</p>
<h2 id="random"><code>random</code></h2>
<p>The <code>random</code> package provides several functions for generating random numbers. It uses a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator when possible, but falls back to a weaker random number generator when cryptographically strong randomness is not available (on older browsers or on servers that don't have enough entropy to seed the cryptographically strong generator).</p>
<dl class="callbacks">
<dt><span class="name">Random.id([n])</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a unique identifier, such as <code>"Jjwjg6gouWLXhMGKW"</code>, that is likely to be unique in the whole world. The optional argument <code>n</code> specifies the length of the identifier in characters and defaults to 17.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">Random.secret([n])</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a random string of printable characters with 6 bits of entropy per character. The optional argument <code>n</code> specifies the length of the secret string and defaults to 43 characters, or 256 bits of entropy. Use <code>Random.secret</code> for security-critical secrets that are intended for machine, rather than human, consumption.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">Random.fraction()</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a number between 0 and 1, like <code>Math.random</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">Random.choice(arrayOrString)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a random element of the given array or string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="name">Random.hexString(n)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a random string of <code>n</code> hexadecimal digits.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="underscore"><code>underscore</code></h2>
<p><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides support for functional programming. It is invaluable for writing clear, concise JavaScript in a functional style.</p>
<p>The <code>underscore</code> package defines the <code>_</code> namespace on both the client and the server.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>Currently, underscore is included in all projects, as the Meteor core depends on it. _ is available in the global namespace on both the client and the server even if you do not include this package. However if you do use underscore in your application, you should still add the package as we will remove the default underscore in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>We have slightly modified the way Underscore differentiates between objects and arrays in <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#each">collection functions</a>. The original Underscore logic is to treat any object with a numeric <code>length</code> property as an array (which helps it work properly on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList"><code>NodeList</code>s</a>). In Meteor's version of Underscore, objects with a numeric <code>length</code> property are treated as objects if they have no prototype (specifically, if <code>x.constructor === Object</code>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="webapp"><code>webapp</code></h2>
<p>The <code>webapp</code> package is what lets your Meteor app serve content to a web browser. It is included in the <code>meteor-platform</code> set of packages that is automatically added when you run <code>meteor create</code>. You can easily build a Meteor app without it - for example if you wanted to make a command-line tool that still used the Meteor package system and DDP.</p>
<p>This package also allows you to add handlers for HTTP requests. This lets other services access your app's data through an HTTP API, allowing it to easily interoperate with tools and frameworks that don't yet support DDP.</p>
<p><code>webapp</code> exposes the <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect">connect</a> API for handling requests through <code>WebApp.connectHandlers</code>. Here's an example that will let you handle a specific URL:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs js"><span class="hljs-comment">// Listen to incoming HTTP requests, can only be used on the server</span>
WebApp.connectHandlers.use(<span class="hljs-string">"/hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(req, res, next)</span> </span>{
  res.writeHead(<span class="hljs-number">200</span>);
  res.end(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello world from: "</span> + Meteor.release);
});
</code></pre>
<p><code>WebApp.connectHandlers.use([path], handler)</code> has two arguments:</p>
<p><strong>path</strong> - an optional path field. This handler will only be called on paths that match this string. The match has to border on a <code>/</code> or a <code>.</code>. For example, <code>/hello</code> will match <code>/hello/world</code> and <code>/hello.world</code>, but not <code>/hello_world</code>.</p>
<p><strong>handler</strong> - this is a function that takes three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>req</strong> - a Node.js <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage">IncomingMessage</a> object with some extra properties. This argument can be used to get information about the incoming request.</li>
<li><strong>res</strong> - a Node.js <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse">ServerResponse</a> object. Use this to write data that should be sent in response to the request, and call <code>res.end()</code> when you are done.</li>
<li><strong>next</strong> - a function. Calling this function will pass on the handling of this request to the next relevant handler.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h1 id="commandline">Command line</h1>
<p>The following are some of the more commonly used commands in the <code>meteor</code> command-line tool. This is just an overview and does not mention every command or every option to every command; for more details, use the <code>meteor help</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="meteorhelp">meteor help</h3>
<p>Get help on meteor command line usage. Running <code>meteor help</code> by itself will list the common meteor commands. Running <code>meteor help <em>command</em></code> will print detailed help about the command.</p>
<h3 id="meteorrun">meteor run</h3>
<p>Run a meteor development server in the current project. Searches upward from the current directory for the root directory of a Meteor project. Whenever you change any of the application's source files, the changes are automatically detected and applied to the running application.</p>
<p>You can use the application by pointing your web browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>. No internet connection is required.</p>
<p>This is the default command. Simply running <code>meteor</code> is the same as <code>meteor run</code>.</p>
<p>To pass additional options to Node.js use the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable. For example: <code>NODE_OPTIONS='--debug'</code> or <code>NODE_OPTIONS='--debug-brk'</code></p>
<p>Run <code>meteor help run</code> to see the full list of options.</p>
<h3 id="meteordebug">meteor debug</h3>
<p>Run the project, but suspend the server process for debugging.</p>
<p>The server process will be suspended just before the first statement of server code that would normally execute. In order to continue execution of server code, use either the web-based Node Inspector or the command-line debugger (further instructions will be printed in the console).</p>
<p>Breakpoints can be set using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger" target="_blank"><code>debugger</code> keyword</a>, or through the web UI of Node Inspector ("Sources" tab).</p>
<p>The server process debugger will listen for incoming connections from debugging clients, such as node-inspector, on port 5858 by default. To specify a different port use the <code>--debug-port &lt;port&gt;</code> option.</p>
<p>The same debugging functionality can be achieved by adding the <code>--debug-port &lt;port&gt;</code> option to other <code>meteor</code> tool commands, such as <code>meteor run</code> and <code>meteor test-packages</code>.</p>
<h3 id="meteorcreate">meteor create <em>name</em></h3>
<p>Create a new Meteor project. By default, makes a subdirectory named <em>name</em> and copies in the template app. You can pass an absolute or relative path.</p>
<p>You can use the --package option, to create a new package. If used in an existing app, this command will create a package in the packages directory.</p>
<h3 id="meteordeploy">meteor deploy <em>site</em></h3>
<p>Deploy the project in your current directory to Meteor's servers.</p>
<p>You can deploy to any available name under <code>meteor.com</code> without any additional configuration, for example, <code>myapp.meteor.com</code>. If you deploy to a custom domain, such as <code>myapp.mydomain.com</code>, then you'll need to make sure the DNS for that domain is configured to point at <code>origin.meteor.com</code>.</p>
<p>The first time you deploy an app you'll be prompted for an email address &mdash; follow the link in your email to finish setting up your account.</p>
<p>Once you have your account you can log in and log out from the command line, check your username with <code>meteor whoami</code>, and run <code>meteor authorized</code> to give other Meteor developers permissions to deploy your app and access its database and logs.</p>
<p>You can deploy in debug mode by passing <code>--debug</code>. This will leave your source code readable by your favorite in-browser debugger, just like it is in local development mode.</p>
<p>To delete an application you've deployed, specify the <code>--delete</code> option along with the site.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>If you use a domain name other than <code>meteor.com</code> you must ensure that the name resolves to <code>origin.meteor.com</code>. If you want a top-level domain like myapp.com, you'll need a DNS A record, matching the IP address of origin.meteor.com.</p>
</div>
<p>You can add information specific to a particular deployment of your application by using the <code>--settings</code> option. The argument to <code>--settings</code> is a file containing any JSON string. The object in your settings file will appear on the server side of your application in <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteor_settings"><code>Meteor.settings</code></a>.</p>
<p>Settings are persistent. When you redeploy your app, the old value will be preserved unless you explicitly pass new settings using the <code>--settings</code> option. To unset <code>Meteor.settings</code>, pass an empty settings file.</p>
<h3 id="meteorlogs">meteor logs <em>site</em></h3>
<p>Retrieves the server logs for the named Meteor application.</p>
<p>Meteor redirects the output of <code>console.log()</code> in your server code into a logging server. <code>meteor logs</code> displays those logs. In client code, the output of <code>console.log()</code> is available in your web browser's inspector, just like any other client-side JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="meteorupdate">meteor update</h3>
<p>Attempts to bring you to the latest version of Meteor, and then to upgrade your packages to their latest versions. By default, update will not break compatibility.</p>
<p>For example, let's say packages A and B both depend on version 1.1.0 of package X. If a new version of A depends on X@2.0.0, but there is no new version of package B, running <code>meteor update</code> will not update A, because doing so will break package B.</p>
<p>You can pass in the flag <code>--packages-only</code> to update only the packages, and not the release itself. Similarly, you can pass in names of packages (<code>meteor update foo:kittens baz:cats</code>) to only update specific packages.</p>
<p>Every project is pinned to a specific release of Meteor. You can temporarily try using your package with another release by passing the <code>--release</code> option to any command; <code>meteor update</code> changes the pinned release.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Meteor will ask you to run <code>meteor update --patch</code>. Patch releases are special releases that contain only very minor change (usually crucial bug fixes) from previous releases. We highly recommend that you always run <code>update --patch</code> when prompted.</p>
<p>You may also pass the <code>--release</code> flag to act as an override to update to a specific release. This is an override: if it cannot find compatible versions of packages, it will log a warning, but perform the update anyway. This will only change your package versions if nessesary.</p>
<h3 id="meteoradd">meteor add <em>package</em></h3>
<p>Add packages to your Meteor project. By convention, names of community packages include the name of the maintainer. For example: <code>meteor add iron:router</code>. You can add multiple packages with one command</p>
<p>Optionally, adds version constraints. Running <code>meteor add package@1.1.0</code> will add the package at version <code>1.1.0</code> or higher (but not <code>2.0.0</code> or higher). If you want to use version <code>1.1.0</code> exactly, use <code>meteor add package@=1.1.0</code>. You can also 'or' constraints together: for example, <code>meteor add 'package@=1.0.0 || =2.0.1'</code> means either 1.0.0 (exactly) or 2.0.1 (exactly).</p>
<p>To remove a version constraint for a specific package, run <code>meteor add</code> again without specifying a version. For example above, to stop using version <code>1.1.0</code> exactly, run <code>meteor add package</code>.</p>
<h3 id="meteorremove">meteor remove <em>package</em></h3>
<p>Removes a package previously added to your Meteor project. For a list of the packages that your application is currently using, run <code>meteor list</code>.</p>
<p>This removes the package entirely. To continue using the package, but remove its version constraint, use <a href="http://localhost:3000/#meteoradd"><code>meteor add</code></a>.</p>
<p>Meteor does not downgrade transitive dependencies unless it's necessary. This means that if running <code>meteor add A</code> upgrades A's parent package X to a new version, your project will continue to use X at the new version even after you run <code>meteor remove A</code>.</p>
<h3 id="meteorlist">meteor list</h3>
<p>Lists all the packages that you have added to your project. For each package, lists the version that you are using. Lets you know if a newer version of that package is available.</p>
<h3 id="meteoraddplatform">meteor add-platform <em>platform</em></h3>
<p>Adds platforms to your Meteor project. You can add multiple platforms with one command. Once a platform has been added, you can use 'meteor run <em>platform</em>' to run on the platform, and 'meteor build' to build the Meteor project for every added platform.</p>
<h3 id="meteorremoveplatform">meteor remove-platform <em>platform</em></h3>
<p>Removes a platform previously added to your Meteor project. For a list of the platforms that your application is currently using, see 'meteor list-platforms'.</p>
<h3 id="meteorlistplatforms">meteor list-platforms</h3>
<p>Lists all of the platforms that have been explicitly added to your project.</p>
<h3 id="meteormongo">meteor mongo</h3>
<p>Open a MongoDB shell on your local development database, so that you can view or manipulate it directly.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>For now, you must already have your application running locally with <code>meteor run</code>. This will be easier in the future.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="meteorreset">meteor reset</h3>
<p>Reset the current project to a fresh state. Removes the local mongo database.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>This deletes your data! Make sure you do not have any information you care about in your local mongo database by running <code>meteor mongo</code>. From the mongo shell, use <code>show collections</code> and <code>db.<em>collection</em>.find()</code> to inspect your data.</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>For now, you can not run this while a development server is running. Quit all running meteor applications before running this.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="meteorbuild">meteor build</h3>
<p>Package this project up for deployment. The output is a directory with several build artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tarball that includes everything necessary to run the application server (see `README` in the tarball for details)</li>
<li>an unassigned `apk` bundle and a project source if Android is targetted as a mobile platform</li>
<li>a directory with an Xcode project source if iOS is targetted as a mobile platform</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the application server bundle to host a Meteor application on your own server, instead of deploying to Meteor's servers. You will have to deal with logging, monitoring, backups, load-balancing, etc, all of which we handle for you if you use <code>meteor deploy</code>.</p>
<p>Unassigned <code>apk</code> bundle and the outputted Xcode project can be used to deploy your mobile apps to Android Play Store and Apple App Store.</p>
<p>By default, your application is bundled for your current architecture. This may cause difficulties if your app contains binary code due to, for example, npm packages. You can try to override that behavior with the --architecture flag.</p>
<h3 id="meteorsearch">meteor search</h3>
<p>Searches for Meteor packages and releases, whose names contain the specified regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="meteorshow">meteor show</h3>
<p>Shows more information about a specific package or release: name, summary, the usernames of its maintainers, and, if specified, its homepage and git URL.</p>
<h3 id="meteorpublish">meteor publish</h3>
<p>Publishes your package. To publish, you must cd into the package directory, log in with your Meteor Developer Account and run <code>meteor publish</code>. By convention, published package names must begin with the maintainer's Meteor Development Accounts username and a colon, like so: <code>iron:router</code>.</p>
<p>To publish a package for the first time, use <code>meteor publish --create</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes packages may contain binary code specific to an architecture (for example, they may use an npm package). In that case, running publish will only upload the build to the architecture that you were using to publish it. You can use <code>publish-for-arch</code> to upload a build to a different architecture from a different machine.</p>
<h3 id="meteorpublishforarch">meteor publish-for-arch</h3>
<p>Publishes a build of an existing package version from a different architecture.</p>
<p>Some packages contain code specific to an architecture. Running <code>publish</code> by itself, will upload the build to the architecture that you were using to publish. You need to run <code>publish-for-arch</code> from a different architecture to upload a different build.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you published name:cool-binary-blob from a Mac. If you want people to be able to use cool-binary-blob from Linux, you should log into a Linux machine and then run <code>meteor publish-for-arch name:cool-binary-blob@version</code>. It will notice that you are on a linux machine, and that there is no Linux-compatible build for your package and publish one.</p>
<p>Currently, the supported architectures for Meteor are 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux and Mac OS. The servers for <code>meteor deploy</code> run 64-bit Linux.</p>
<h3 id="meteorpublishrelease">meteor publish-release</h3>
<p>Publishes a release of Meteor. Takes in a json configuration file.</p>
<p>Meteor releases are divided into tracks. While only MDG members can publish to the default Meteor track, anyone can create a track of their own and publish to it. Running <code>meteor update</code> without specifying the <code>--release</code> option will not cause the user to switch tracks.</p>
<p>To publish to a release track for the first time, use the <code>create-track</code> flag.</p>
<p>The JSON configuration file must contain the name of the release track (<code>track</code>), the release version (<code>version</code>), various metadata, the packages specified by the release as mapped to versions (<code>packages</code>), and the package &amp; version of the Meteor command-line tool (<code>tool</code>). Note that this means that forks of the meteor tool can be published as packages and people can use them by switching to a corresponding release. For more information, run <code>meteor help publish-release</code>.</p>
<h3 id="meteortestpackages">meteor test-packages</h3>
<p>Test Meteor packages, either by name, or by directory. Not specifying an argument will run tests for all local packages. The results are displayed in an app that runs at <code>localhost:3000</code> by default. If you need to, you can pass the <code>--settings</code> and <code>--port</code> arguments.</p>
<h3 id="meteoradmin">meteor admin</h3>
<p>Catch-all for miscellaneous commands that require authorization to use.</p>
<p>Some example uses of <code>meteor admin</code> include adding and removing package maintainers and setting a homepage for a package. It also includes various helpful functions for managing a Meteor release. Run <code>meteor help admin</code> for more information.</p>
